Citizens Advice Scotland said the number of employment cases it had seen had risen by 12% in the last four years and was  now at its highest level. It said the most common issues involved low pay, withheld wages and unfair dismissal, as well as bullying and discrimination. CAS has highlighted the issues in a report to MSPs. Holyrood's Economy, Energy and Tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession. CAS said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in Scotland. Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials. Delivering the report to the Scottish Parliament, the charity's spokesman Rob Gowans said:  ""What our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the Scottish CAB (Citizen Advice Bureaux) service over the last few years. ""While we don't give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience. There is a growing crisis of low pay and poor conditions in Scotland. ""Around half of Scots who are in poverty are actually working. This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut. He added: ""With wages falling in real terms, families are becoming trapped in poverty, less secure terms and working hours, and with basic employment rights becoming harder to enforce."" Mr Gowans also raised concerns about ""too many rogue employers"" who were ""exploiting"" workers under this environment. ""The growth in zero hours contracts has become a huge problem, which leaves thousands of Scots in huge financial uncertainty. And meanwhile it is becoming harder than ever to challenge unfair treatment,"" he added. SNP MSP Christina McKelvie described the CAS report as ""worrying"" and called for the Scottish Parliament to be given more powers over employment policy. She said: ""This Citizens Advice Scotland report outlines the shocking impact of austerity, social security cuts and worrying examples of employers flouting employment law.""","Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) has released a report highlighting the growing crisis of low pay and poor working conditions in Scotland.

this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble

and wheezing, over the past six months. She has been using an albuterol inhaler, Ventolin, but finds that it only provides temporary relief. She uses the inhaler almost daily, often waking up in the middle of the night to use it. Despite this, she has not been able to get her symptoms under control and has had to visit the urgent care and emergency department multiple times.

Betty's asthma symptoms tend to flare up when she gets sick with a cold, and she has noticed that exposure to her aunt's cat can trigger an attack. She has also experienced symptoms after being around secondhand smoke in bars.

The patient's doctor is concerned about her frequent hospital visits and the use of steroids to manage her symptoms. The doctor wants to take a closer look at her medical history and perform a physical exam to better understand her condition and develop a treatment plan",

had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are

Responsibility for the Wales and Border network will be devolved in 2017. A Department of Transport spokesman said no decisions would be made without considering local views. Services from Aberystwyth to Birmingham and Milford Haven to Manchester via Cardiff, are among routes which could be affected. In last year's St David's Day agreement, the UK government wrote: ""In order for the secretary of state for transport to ensure proper accountability, it is likely that services primarily serving English markets will be placed into other franchises for which the Secretary of State for Transport is the franchising authority"". Responding to suggestions some passengers may have to change trains on cross-border routes, Mrs Hart said some Whitehall officials ""don't actually understand how things work and what are important"". ""I base some of their comments on ignorance rather than a conspiracy theory,"" she said. ""We want to ensure those services remain within the franchise."" John Rogers from campaign group Railfutures Wales said: ""It's ludicrous, it's impractical, it's being done behind the scenes with a lot of secrecy initially and we're determined to fight it"". ""It's not in the interests of passengers.  People hate changing trains, it's a deterrent and it would affect the tourist industry,"" he added.

Charles mentions that he has been experiencing shortness of breath and has noticed that his breathing has changed over time. He also mentions that he has a refrigerator full of venison and has been hunting. The doctor asks about other symptoms, including eye watering, which Charles attributes to allergies. The doctor notes that Charles has been prescribed an inhaler and has used a nebulizer in the past.

The doctor performs a physical exam and finds that Charles's vital signs are normal, but notes some faint expiratory wheezing in his lungs. The doctor reviews Charles's chest X-ray and pulmonary function test, which were both normal. Based on the symptoms and exam findings, the doctor diagnoses Charles with newly diagnosed allergic asthma.

The doctor prescribes an albuterol inhaler and Singulair, a medication to help decrease the occurrences of asthma symptoms. The doctor also recommends allergy testing, including skin testing, to identify potential triggers. The doctor schedules a follow-up appointment for the next week to conduct the skin testing",

You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight. But Shakespeare's Globe on London's Bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers. Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics The Globe's site beside the River Thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor Jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse. Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself. Farah Karim-Cooper, one of the Globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources. The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"". But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says Dr Karim-Cooper. The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences. ""We're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says. But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice. Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre? It was something that happened regularly in Shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor Globe to an indoor playhouse such as the Blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the River Thames. It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub. The Globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight. The Globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light. And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles. Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era. ""Darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says Dr Karim-Cooper. ""Darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick. It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there."" She says that if Elizabethans or Jacobeans travelled in time to modern London ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"". Another big difference is that Shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage. The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown. In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen. The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors. And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed Globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play. ""It was a very social occasion,"" says Dr Karim-Cooper, describing the Shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing. ""Contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says. Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed. For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says Dr Karim-Cooper. Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue. When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment. There are other big changes between a modern and Shakespearean theatre visit. It would have smelled very different, says Dr Karim-Cooper. There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together. Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says. It would have been a much softer sound, as Elizabethan London didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music. ""In terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says. ""There are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming. They never heard a plane taking off."" The language would have sounded unusual too. The accent of the time would have meant words such as ""move"" and ""love"" would have sounded much closer to rhyming. And the Globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation. The role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors. ""There is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do. It wouldn't work,"" says Dr Karim-Cooper. Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions. They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days. ""We want to get beyond Wikipedia,"" she says. She is co-editor of Moving Shakespeare Indoors, a collection of essays on indoor Jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the Globe's work. There is a postgraduate degree course in Shakespeare Studies with King's College, London. There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers. Every year there is a landmark schools production, the Playing Shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for London pupils. It's been a huge success, with many  coming to see Shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before. Dr Karim-Cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory. ""We want to become a research hub. We want students to be here."" The ""unique blend"" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the ""literary rigour"". ""We don't separate the practical from the academic.""","Shakespeare's Globe in London is a unique institution that combines academic research with theatrical performances. The theatre has a team of in-house scholars, researchers, and academic advisors who inform every aspect of the productions, from the physical design of the theatre to the individual performances. The Globe has recently opened a new indoor Jacobean theatre, the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, which was designed using historical evidence and contemporary sources. The theatre is a living laboratory, where the team experiments with different approaches to staging Shakespeare's plays, including the use of candlelight, pulley-operated candelabras, and a more intimate audience-actor relationship.

The Globe's research team, led by Farah Karim-Cooper, provides practical advice to actors and directors, drawing on their expertise in historical accuracy and theatrical practice. They also work with local schools and universities, offering education programs and training events for teachers. The theatre's goal is to become a research hub, where students can engage in dramatic experimentation alongside literary rigor.

The Globe's approach to staging Shakespeare's plays is distinct from traditional approaches, which often prioritize historical accuracy over practical considerations. Instead, the team seeks to create a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences, using the theatre as a laboratory to test new ideas and approaches",

On a night when Wembley paid its respects to the late Dutch legend Johan Cruyff with applause in the 14th minute, a much-changed England side slipped to a rare defeat at the national stadium. Man-of-the-match Jamie Vardy rounded off a slick passing move to steer in Kyle Walker's cross four minutes before the interval - but Roy Hodgson's side could not protect their lead. England's defence lived on the edge too often and were eventually punished when a sloppy passage of play led to Danny Rose handling, and Vincent Janssen scored from the spot after 50 minutes. The big striker was then too strong for substitute Phil Jagielka, although England complained bitterly he had been fouled, before crossing for Luciano Narsingh to score the winner 13 minutes from  time. Vardy's transition from the heights he has scaled with Leicester City this season to England has been seamless - and he has stepped up a level in the two friendlies against Germany and the Netherlands. The 29-year-old has been portrayed as both an ideal starter and the perfect impact substitute as Hodgson makes plans for Euro 2016. Vardy has proved his capabilities for both, with an explosive 20-minute cameo in Berlin that included a brilliantly instinctive finish as part of England's comeback. And here, he was England's outstanding performer by some distance, showing the pace and energy that has panicked Premier League defences and also skill to round off that passing move with a clinical finish before testing Dutch keeper Jeroen Zoet with a powerful rising drive. The debate about how best to use Vardy may go on but one thing is beyond dispute - he is going to Euro 2016 and has the ability to threaten every defence in France. In an ideal world, Everton's John Stones would have come in at Wembley to produce the sort of elegant display that became his trademark in the early seasons of his career, thus cementing his place alongside Chris Smalling for England's first Euro 2016 game against Russia in Marseille. Instead, Wembley witnessed a 21-year-old whose confidence has been hit by a recent dip in form at club level and will need a little renovating before the serious action gets under way. Stones twice brought murmurs of concern from England's fans inside Wembley with his tendency to perhaps over-play out of defence, but his determination to be constructive also started the passing move that led to Vardy's goal. The young defender is a work in progress and there will be slips - quite literally when he stumbled at the start of a chain of events that led to England keeper Fraser Forster having to save well from Janssen before Rose handled to leave the striker to score from the spot. Stones is well worth persevering with - but Hodgson must hope some of that confidence and composure returns quickly. Hodgson warned they must not get carried away after victory in Germany - and, in case anyone ignored the warning, along comes a defeat against a Dutch team that will not even be in France this summer. In some respects this defeat, albeit with a much-changed side, simply reinforced some of the lessons that came out of the win in Germany that was the catalyst for such a surge of optimism. England have some very exciting options up front in the shape of Vardy and Harry Kane, while Daniel Sturridge also got a decent 57 minutes under his belt. Questions remain, however, about a frail-looking defence with both full-back spots still up for grabs and no central-defensive pairing jumping out as Hodgson's first choice at this stage. England certainly carry a threat but fears persist about their ability to resist attacks of the highest calibre. Fraser Forster: Solid night for the Southampton keeper despite a couple of fumbles. Saved well from Georginio Wijnaldum and Vincent Janssen. Clear deputy to Joe Hart. 7. Kyle Walker: Solid and quick in defence and a threat in attack with a perfect pass for Vardy to score England's goal. 7. Chris Smalling: Part of an uncertain central-defensive partnership that once again hinted at England's frailty against attacks possessing real quality. 6. John Stones: Not a great night for Everton's 21-year-old. Yes, his determination to play started the move for England's goal but too often caused anxiety with his tendency to overdo things and second-half slip started chain of events that led to the Dutch equaliser. 5. Danny Rose: Not an easy night for England's defence but Rose kept going and may consider himself unlucky to be punished for the handball that led to a penalty. 6. James Milner: Anonymous as England's captain. Milner is a solid presence but not big on inspirational moments. 5. Danny Drinkwater: Solid debut from the Leicester City midfielder. Did himself no harm and can be happy with his debut but did he make a compelling case for inclusion in Euro 2016? Not sure. 6. Ross Barkley: Busy first half and a trademark second-half surge that set up a chance for Adam Lallana. 6. Adam Lallana: Decent night for the Liverpool midfielder. Clever pass played its part in England's goal and was warmly applauded when substituted. 7. Daniel Sturridge: Once he'd stopped fiddling with his bootlaces he settled down and produced one or two moments that hint at the threat he could yet pose for England. 6. Jamie Vardy: England's star man. Busy, scored one and could have had another. 8. Substitutes: Walcott (for Sturridge, 57 minutes): Odd flash of pace and one rising shot over the bar but otherwise quiet. 6. Clyne (for Rose, 57 minutes): Not much of an opportunity and consequently not much impact. 5. Kane (for Lallana, 70 minutes): Just a couple of half-chances but no rescue act from the man who is now England's first-choice striker. 5. Jagielka (for Smalling, 70 minutes): Claimed he was fouled by Janssen in the lead-up to the winner but should have been stronger in that situation. 5. Alli (for Milner, 82 minutes): No rating. Dier (for Drinkwater, 84 minutes): No rating. The Three Lions wait until 21 May to host Turkey, while Netherlands meet Republic of Ireland six days later. Match ends, England 1, Netherlands 2.

The Dutch team, which has not qualified for Euro 2016, came back to win 2-1 with goals from Vincent Janssen and Luciano Narsingh. Vardy was England's standout player, scoring one goal and creating another, but the team's defense was vulnerable and conceded two goals. John Stones, a 21-year-old defender, had a difficult game and was at fault for one of the Dutch goals. The defeat was a setback for England, which had been boosted by a win over Germany in its previous friendly. The team will need to regroup and improve its defense before the start of Euro 2016",

James fell on his left side while going up stairs five months ago and has been having pain ever since. He has tried to continue his exercise routine, but the pain has worsened with lifting and has caused him to stop going to the gym. James has also noticed that the pain is worse when he lifts weights, but has not taken any pain medication.

During the examination, Dr. Isabella finds that James's pain is localized to his left shoulder and elbow, with tenderness in the affected areas. She performs several tests, including the Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer's tests, and finds that James has impingement syndrome of his left shoulder. She explains to James that the pain in his wrist is likely due to the shoulder impingement.

Dr. Isabella recommends starting with physical therapy, with two sessions per week, and recommends that James continue to ice his shoulder and rest as much as possible. She also offers the option of a cortisone injection if the physical therapy does not improve James's symptoms. James agrees to start with physical therapy and will follow up with Dr. Isabella if his symptoms worsen or do not improve",

The doctor orders an ankle brachial index (ABI) to assess blood supply to the foot, performs a debridement to remove dead tissue, and prescribes a collagenase ointment to be applied daily. The patient is also advised to wear a surgical shoe to reduce pressure on the area and to return in two weeks. Additionally, the doctor recommends a diabetic consult to help the patient control their diabetes and improve wound healing",

Fawzi al-Odah, 37, was released after a US review panel concluded he was not a ""continuing significant threat"". He had been at the US facility in Cuba since 2002 after his arrest in Pakistan on suspicion of links to al-Qaeda and the Taliban - a charge he denies. He had challenged America's right to detain him in the US Supreme Court. Mr Odah boarded a Kuwaiti government plane on Wednesday morning US time. ""There's no bitterness, there's no anger,"" his lawyer Eric Lewis was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. ""There's just excitement and joy that he will be going home."" The release came after Guantanamo's Periodic Review Board in July determined ""that continued law of war detention of (Mr Odah) does not remain necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States"". But he now faces at least a year at a militant rehabilitation centre in Kuwait, according to the terms of the release. The Kuwaiti government had pushed hard for the release of all Kuwaiti detainees at Guantanamo. Mr Odah had argued that he travelled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to teach the Koran and provide humanitarian aid. He is the first inmate to be freed since May, when five Taliban detainees were exchanged for US Sgt Bowe Bergdahl, who had been kept by the insurgents in Afghanistan. Mr Odah's release brings down the total number of inmates at the US naval base to 148. The US opened the facility in January 2002, following the 11 September 2001 attacks in America.

starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem

45-year-old male patient, Jerry, presented to the doctor with an ankle injury sustained while playing basketball with his 10-year-old son. Jerry landed awkwardly and twisted his ankle, causing bruising, swelling, and instability. He has been having trouble walking and is concerned about disrupting his recent progress in getting back into working out.

The doctor examined Jerry's ankle and diagnosed a lateral malleolar fracture, which is likely to require surgery to heal properly. The doctor estimated that Jerry will need to be out for about three months, but encouraged him to continue coaching his son's basketball team in April. Jerry will need to use crutches and follow a treatment plan that includes medication, icing, and elevating his ankle.

The doctor also prescribed meloxicam to help reduce swelling and pain. Jerry works from home, which will make it easier for him to elevate his ankle regularly. The doctor offered words of encouragement and support, acknowledging that it's a setback but promising to help Jerry get back to his normal activities as soon as possible",

(not going to lie, it took everything i had in me not to laugh when he mentioned jesus). anyway, the result is that my parents hate me, my aunt and uncle despise me and i doubt anyone in my family will ever speak to me again, guess it's time to revert back to my reclusive existence because family interaction is now a thing of the past. &nbsp;","The writer had a disastrous encounter with their cousin at a family breakfast, where the younger kids were excitedly talking about Easter. The writer, who is not a fan of young children, found it humorous at first but eventually got frustrated and went upstairs to their room.

However, the cousin took it seriously and started questioning the existence of other mythical figures like Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and Jesus. The writer's aunt and uncle were left with the task of convincing their son that the Easter bunny is real, and the writer's parents gave them a death stare.

[doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so [doctor] okay [patient] of course [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good,"A patient, Bobby, visits a doctor with persistent right shoulder pain that has been ongoing for a few weeks. The pain started after doing yard work and projects, and has not subsided despite taking Advil and icing the area. The doctor asks about the patient's medical history, including a previous injury to the same shoulder while playing baseball. The patient reports that the pain is more on the outside of the shoulder and is tender when raising his arm. The doctor performs a physical exam and reviews the patient's vitals, which are all normal.

The doctor diagnoses the patient with rotator cuff tendinopathy and orders an MRI to rule out any other conditions. The doctor also refers the patient to physical therapy for 6-8 weeks and recommends continuing to take Tylenol. If the symptoms do not improve, a steroid injection may be considered.

The patient also mentions that his feet and ankles are sore, possibly due to overuse from yard work. The doctor suggests trying Epsom salts to help relax the muscles and reduce soreness",

When it didn't feel hot, they moved the lighter's spring-loaded piece and still didn't get a reaction. Assuming it was broken, they put it back and later discovered they could push the lighter in.

the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe [doctor] okay [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot [doctor] okay [patient] let me

that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles

problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be

Media playback is not supported on this device A World Anti-Doping Agency commission report has accused Russia of running a ""state-sponsored"" doping programme. And Warner said he feels sports other than athletics have reason to be concerned at how Russian sport is run. ""This iceberg spreads in two different directions,"" he said. ""I suspect there are probably four, five or six nations that athletics has a problem with."" Commission chairman Dick Pound said Russia's athletics federation, Araf, should be banned from the Rio 2016 Olympics. Warner told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Every other international sport today should be looking at Russian sport and looking at whether the men and women who compete in their events are clean."" ""They do not have robust anti-doping regimes. They are asleep on the job - and they have to be rooted out."" Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, also implicated the International Association of Athletics' Federations. The IAAF's former president Lamine Diack has been provisionally suspended by the International Olympic Committee, who have also asked the IAAF to start disciplinary action against the athletes named in the report. Araf has been told to respond to the report by Friday and Russia have defended their position. Acting head of Russia Athletics Federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said: ""There is an element of a political hit job here because quite a few things were described in the report in a biased way."" Russia's sports ministry has said it will work more closely with Wada, Igor Zagorskiy, deputy director of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, Rusada, told the BBC: ""There is always room for improvement. ""We are on that track and we've been on that track together with Wada. We will continue this work on this."" Warner says the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), must be restructured to combat the problem. He revealed that he had spoken to IAAF president Lord Coe since Monday's publication of Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, and also implicated the IAAF. The 323-page report said that ""acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread"" in Russia and suggested that neither Araf, Rusada, nor the Russian Federation can be considered anti-doping code-compliant. The report also said the London 2012 Olympics were ""sabotaged"" by ""widespread inaction"" against athletes with suspicious doping profiles; accuses Moscow laboratory director Grigory Rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five Russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans. Media playback is not supported on this device Pound, who chaired the Wada investigation, said the situation was ""worse than we thought"", adding that ""it may be a residue of the old Soviet Union system"". Warner backed the recommendation to suspend Russia from competition ""until they put their house in order"", adding: ""If you punish one or two innocent Russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma I am willing to grasp."" He also suggested that Russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that ""athletics has probably got some other nations to root out"". He added that while ""there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics"", he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the Western world. During a special BBC Radio 5 live programme examining the independent report, Britain's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said: ""I don't think anyone is under the impression it's only Russia."" On the same programme, former British sprinter Darren Campbell warned of ""darker days to come"". He said: ""This report was about Russia, and they need to be punished if this holds up, but we'll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on Russia. It's about cleaning everything out. ""There's people talking about testing out in Kenya and Jamaica. We can't have rumours anymore. ""We need to understand how the Russians got away with it. How did this happen yet nobody knew? ""No matter how dark and depressing it gets, change has to happen now."" Coe, elected IAAF president in August, described the Wada report as ""alarming"" and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the Russian federation. The report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by IAAF officials and found the governing body to be ""inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood (and other) profiles"". Media playback is not supported on this device It has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations, with Coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as ""a declaration of war on my sport"" in August. On Monday, Coe said that ""if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme I will fix them"". But Warner says Coe needs to restructure the IAAF in order for it to effectively tackle the problem. ""This cannot be a one-man crusade,"" Warner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""He needs to ensure there is a bench around him at the IAAF who dramatically improve the operation. ""We all know, and he has already said, he needs to go out and hire a good chief executive. ""It needs more than that. He also possibly needs a chairman under him so he can take the lead of the elected council and be the ambassador for the sport and have full-time professional staff, possibly from outside sport, from elsewhere in business, who can get a grip on the organisation.""","UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner has stated that Russia is not the only country with systemic doping problems, and that other nations may also be guilty of doping. Warner's comments come after a World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) commission report accused Russia of running a ""state-sponsored"" doping program in athletics. The report also implicated the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and recommended that Russia's athletics federation be banned from the Rio 2016 Olympics.

Warner believes that other international sports should be concerned about Russian sport and whether athletes competing in their events are clean. He also thinks that the IAAF needs to be restructured to effectively tackle the problem of doping, and that the organization's president, Lord Coe, needs to hire a good chief executive and possibly a chairman to help him lead the organization.

The Wada report found evidence of widespread doping in Russia, including the destruction of samples and the acceptance of bribes by officials. The report also recommended that five Russian athletes and five coaches be given lifetime doping bans.

Warner's comments suggest that the problem of doping in athletics may be more widespread than previously thought, and that other countries may also be guilty of doping. He believes that the IAAF needs to take a strong stance against doping and that the organization's leadership needs to be restructured to effectively tackle the problem",

Rivalry between President Thein Sein and Shwe Mann came to a head last Wednesday night when trucks with security sealed off the headquarters of the party. Shwe Mann, who had been seen as a likely successor to Thein Sein, remains speaker of parliament and a USDP member. Ms Suu Kyi and Shwe Mann met for an hour on Monday in the country's capital, Naypyidaw. They have often said that they have a mutual understanding for future co-operation, reports Moe Myint of the BBC Burmese service. One likely area of collaboration might be amendment of the constitution, which prevents Ms Suu Kyi from running for the presidency. Most expect Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy to win the election, but the constitution bars her from becoming president because her children hold British passports.","Here is a summary of the document:

Former Myanmar ruling party chairman Shwe Mann, who was recently sacked, met with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking speculation of an alliance. The meeting comes ahead of the November 8 elections, which are expected to be won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party. Shwe Mann, who remains a member of the ruling party, has been rumored to be discussing an alliance with Suu Kyi, potentially to amend the constitution, which bars her from running for president due to her children's British passports. The meeting has raised hopes of a possible cooperation between the two leaders, who have previously expressed mutual understanding for future collaboration",

Nick Woodman described the remote controlled aircraft as the ""ultimate"" accessory for his firm's action cameras. He made the announcement at the Code Conference in California, where he also unveiled new kit to that helps capture video footage for virtual reality helmets. One industry watcher said GoPro's move into drones was ""very significant"". ""It's the fact that the company has such a strong brand,"" explained John Stapley from Amateur Photographer magazine. ""It's similar to what you can already see with action cameras. There are a lot of others out there but most people don't know they exist or don't have any interest in them because GoPro has become such a dominant name that it is 'the action brand' as far as they are concerned."" The risk for the firm, he added, was that other drone manufacturers would opt to partner with other camera makers to avoid supporting a competitor. The world's bestselling commercial drone maker - China's DJI - has already decided to limit initial sales of its Phantom 3 flagship to a design that features its own proprietary video camera. The previous generation had been launched instead with an optional mount for GoPro cams. Mr Woodman said he planned to release the GoPro drone within the first half of 2016, and that it would be targeted at consumers. ""Quadcopters have a special place for us at GoPro because I was a huge radio-controlled plane enthusiast as a kid and I could never really get anyone involved in it with me because it was either too geeky or it took a lot of time to learn how to fly these things - you'd crash them all the time,"" he said. ""So, I was really surprised to see how quickly the general consumer was adopting quadcopters. ""Quads plus GoPro has been one of the most democratising combinations in terms of enabling people to capture professional quality content and see themselves in their environment in a way that they'd never seen before. It looks like you're in your own movie."" Drones are expected to be one of the fastest growing electronics sectors over the coming years. According to the US's Consumer Electronics Association, the global market for consumer drones totalled $84m (Â£54m) last year but is forecast to top $300m by 2018. The CEA adds that if regulators relax the rules for the use of such aircraft by commercial organisations, the market could further swell to $1bn by 2020. That could represent a lucrative new market for GoPro. The firm's existing cameras and other accessories generated $363m of sales over the first three months of 2015. That was up 54% on the previous year, but resulted in a relatively slim net profit of $16.8m. Mr Woodman also showed off a prototype mount that can hold six of his firm's Hero4 cameras, each pointing in a different direction. He said the resulting footage could be stitched together using software developed by Kolor - a start-up it bought last month - to create a single 6K-quality 360-degree image. This could then be used with virtual reality helmets - allowing a user to change their perspective by turning their head left and right and looking up and down - or via YouTube and Facebook, which are both adding support for interactive spherical videos. The Six-Camera Spherical Array add-on will go on sale later this year. Mr Woodman acknowledged, however, that the high cost of buying enough cameras to fill it was likely to limit the mount's appeal to professionals. At a subsequent event, Google also announced a more elaborate virtual reality capture device, which involves 16 GoPro cameras, as part of a tie-up between the two companies. The footage produced by the Jump camera array will be processed by the search firm's own software to produce panoramas, rather than spherical videos, that make use of depth data deduced by Google's algorithms.","GoPro's CEO, Nick Woodman, has announced that the company will be releasing its own quadcopter drones, which will be designed to work seamlessly with its action cameras. The drones are expected to be released in the first half of 2016 and will be targeted at consumers. Woodman believes that the combination of drones and GoPro cameras will be a ""democratising"" force in enabling people to capture professional-quality content. The drone market is expected to be one of the fastest-growing electronics sectors in the coming years, with the global market forecast to reach $300m by 2018 and potentially $1bn by 2020. GoPro's move into drones is seen as significant, given the company's strong brand recognition and dominance in the action camera market. However, there is a risk that other drone manufacturers may opt to partner with other camera makers to avoid supporting a competitor",

The package was still in transit, so the writer was able to intercept it and reroute it to the correct address with the carrier. However, this process took about 30 minutes and cost $36. The writer reflects on the situation and realizes that they could have simply cancelled the original order and placed a new one for the customer, which would have been faster and cheaper.

[patient] most likely july . [doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time . [patient] okay . [doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ? [patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .

[patient] i would say since i was in high school . [doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup . [patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size . [doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ? [patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future . [doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ? [patient] sometimes , yes . [doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating . [patient] no , but they are always sweaty . [doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ? [patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts . [doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ? [patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol . [doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ? [patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young . [doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ? [patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .

[patient] yeah . [doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . [patient] okay . [doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . [patient] okay . that's fine . [doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well . [patient] right .","The document is a consultation note for a breast reduction surgery with Dr. Gonzalez. The patient, Julia Jones, is a 25-year-old woman who has been considering a breast reduction for about 6-7 years. She has been experiencing back pain, neck pain, and numbness in her hands, which she attributes to her large breasts. She has not had any previous consultations or surgeries related to her breasts.

During the consultation, Dr. Gonzalez takes a medical history, including Julia's family history of breast cancer, and asks about her symptoms, including back pain, numbness, and tingling. Julia also mentions that she has been going to a chiropractor for her back pain and has been taking a migraine medication, Propranolol.

Dr. Gonzalez examines Julia and takes measurements of her breasts. She notes that one breast is slightly lower than the other and that Julia has bra strap indentations on her shoulders. Julia mentions that she has not had any children and may plan to have children in the future.

Dr. Gonzalez explains the breast reduction surgery procedure, which involves removing tissue from the breast, lifting the breasts, and elevating the nipple position to alleviate back and neck pain. She also mentions that the surgery is a common procedure that she performs regularly.

The consultation concludes with Dr. Gonzalez informing Julia that she is a good candidate for the surgery and that she will submit the necessary paperwork to Julia's new insurance provider, which will be Blue Cross Blue Shield",

He is in the emergency room for follow-up and reports feeling woozy due to high blood sugar levels. He was not admitted to the hospital and was able to manage his blood sugar levels after being discharged. The doctor notes that Albert's mother was recently hospitalized for a hip replacement and that Albert may have been eating high-calorie foods while visiting her.

The doctor also checks on Albert's kidney transplant and notes that his kidney function is good. Albert is taking immunotherapy medications as prescribed and has been diligent about following his doctor's orders.

Regarding Albert's depression, he reports that it has been a tough year-and-a-half, but he has been managing his symptoms with relaxation techniques and meditation. The doctor suggests revisiting therapy, but Albert prefers to continue with meditation for now.

The doctor performs a physical exam and finds no signs of distress or abnormalities. Albert's vital signs are normal, and his blood sugar level is 162. The doctor notes that Albert's hemoglobin A1c level is high, indicating poor blood sugar control",

Bethany Hill, 20, was found dead with neck injuries in Stratford-upon-Avon on 3 February last year. It is alleged she was killed by Jack Williams, 21, and his girlfriend, Kayleigh Woods, 23, at the flat they all shared in Hertford Road. The pair, who are on trial at Warwick Crown Court, deny murder. See more stories from across Coventry and Warwickshire here Opening the case, prosecutor Stephen Linehan QC said Miss Hill was a former girlfriend of Williams and had a ""volatile"" relationship with Woods, a transgender woman with whom she had planned to have a child. Jurors heard Miss Hill was found dead by a police officer in a blood-drenched bathroom. Mr Linehan QC told the court: ""In the course of the killing, Beth's wrists were bound together with duct tape and the blade was used to inflict repeated cuts across the back of her neck before she was killed by the jugular vein being cut through."" He said Miss Hill was found dead after Woods, formerly known as Kyle Lockwood, dialled 999 at 19:07 GMT on 3 February, telling the operator: ""Well my best friend is dead in my flat."" Alleging the ""sadistic"" killing may have been carried out for ""perverted pleasure"", Mr Linehan QC said: ""What she was saying was that her friend had killed herself while she was out of the flat and that she had returned to find blood everywhere, and that she had cleaned up the flat before making that telephone call. ""All of these things were lies. Bethany Hill had not died as a result of cutting herself - she had been brutally, brutally murdered. ""She [Woods] lied because she was one of the two people who took part in the killing and the other person was the defendant Jack Williams. Mr Linehan said the pair had ""set about trying to cover up the truth about what they did"" from the moment of the 999 call. The court heard that Miss Hill, who was brought up in Bidford-on-Avon, had a brief relationship with Williams as a teenager. She then moved to Stratford to begin a college course, while Williams, also from the Bidford area, met Woods and moved in with her. Before the alleged killing, the court heard, Miss Hill had also moved into the flat in Hertford Road, using the bedroom, while Woods and Williams slept in the sitting room. The trial continues.","A 20-year-old woman, Bethany Hill, was brutally murdered by her ex-boyfriend Jack Williams and his partner Kayleigh Woods, who then tried to pass off the killing as a suicide. The murder took place in a flat they shared in Stratford-upon-Avon, where Bethany was found dead with neck injuries. The prosecution alleges that Bethany was killed by having her wrists bound with duct tape and being cut across the back of her neck before her jugular vein was cut through.

you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we

of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye [patient] thank you,"The patient, a frequent water skier, visited the doctor with a 5-day-old knee pain in his right knee after twisting it while landing from a jump on his boat. The doctor asked about the injury and the patient reported no popping or feeling of something tearing, but described the knee as swollen and sore. The patient has never had a knee injury before and has been taking Aleve and applying cold packs to alleviate the pain.

The doctor performed a physical exam and found ecchymosis, edema, and an effusion in the right knee, with pain to palpation. The doctor diagnosed a medial collateral ligament strain and ordered an X-ray to rule out any broken bones. The doctor prescribed meloxicam to reduce swelling and pain, and referred the patient to physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the knee.

The doctor also discussed the patient's hypertension and continued the patient's current medication, lisinopril. The doctor also ordered a lipid panel to check the patient's cholesterol levels and scheduled a tetanus shot for the patient.

The patient was advised to rest his knee and avoid further injury, and was told that he would need to wait until the results of the X-ray and physical therapy before resuming water skiing",

Media playback is not supported on this device Rogers needed 14 stitches in his lip after a challenge by Tyrone's Tiernan McCann at the start of the game. ""I think Brendan was quite shocked. Some people were quite horrified,"" said the Derry manager. ""I'll leave it to other people to make up their minds."" The Slaughtneil man had the stitches inserted last Sunday and Barton expects Rogers to be out of action for a couple of more weeks. Rogers was named at midfield for the McKenna Cup final and the match video suggested he may have been caught by McCann's right elbow immediately after challenging for the initial throw-in. After the ball was thrown in, McCann came in from the side and the footage showed the Tyrone man clattering into Rogers although the Red Hand county player appeared to be focusing on the ball rather than the Derry midfielder when the contact was made. ""Brendan has been very quiet about it and we have been very quiet about it as well,"" said Barton after Derry's opening 3-13 to 1-10 Division 2 Football League victory over Fermanagh at Celtic Park. ""It was quite an horrific incident. I wouldn't like to expand on it to be quite frank. Media playback is not supported on this device ""It was an incident that thankfully you don't see very often."" Barton added that he ""couldn't speak"" after the game such was his upset about the incident. ""I think it affected the mood of all of us. ""It overshadowed for me what was a positive night for football. ""I think the amount of respect that was shown between Derry and Tyrone was very evident but it's one of those things I'll let people make up their own minds about."" In terms of Sunday's opening league win, Barton felt that his team had laboured badly in the first half before going on to clinch a nine-point victory over the Erne County. ""We were very flat at the start of the game. We turned over a serious amount of ball under no pressure. ""I was glad to see our first goal going in (before half-time) and I was very happy to see half-time because it gave us an opportunity to restructure and talk about what we felt we were going wrong.

over to see me how're you doing today [patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan [patient] sure sounds good [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you,"The patient, Matthew, has been experiencing back pain for a while, which has worsened over the past month.

The doctor performs a physical exam and finds that Matthew has pain when pressing on the L4 vertebrae and when bending forward. He also has weakness in his left leg, but his reflexes and sensory function are intact.

The doctor reviews Matthew's MRI results, which show a disk herniation at the L4-L5 vertebrae, causing nerve root impingement. The doctor diagnoses Matthew with acute disk herniation at L4-L5 with nerve root impingement and recommends an epidural steroid injection to reduce inflammation and relieve pain.

Rather than having links to radical Islamism, he was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say. The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury. He has been  identified only as Sergej W, and was staying in the team's hotel overlooking the scene of the attack. Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus. Spanish footballer Marc Bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock. Following the attack on 11 April, Borussia Dortmund's home Champions League match against Monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led Dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters. Police initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack. However, the following week, investigators cast ""significant doubt"" on jihadist motivations being behind it. They now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed. Sergej W, 28, would have made about €3.9m euros ($4.2m; £3.2m) from his actions, Germany's Bild newspaper reported. In a statement on Friday (in German), the German federal prosecutor's office said he has German and Russian nationality. He was arrested on Friday near Tubingen in Rottenburg, south-west Germany. The suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on Borussia Dortmund shares - reportedly priced at €78,000 (£65,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack. He would have made large profits if the team's share price collapsed. Experts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because he tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly. He was staying at the team's L'Arrivée hotel in Dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say. The suspect placed the bet on 11 April using an IP address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money. Investigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed. The bus was damaged about six miles from the Westfalenstadion - officially called Signal Iduna Park - in Dortmund about 90 minutes before kick-off. Pictures from the scene showed its windows broken and its tyres burst.","A 28-year-old man, identified as Sergej W, has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions, and causing serious physical injury in an attack on the Borussia Dortmund team bus.

""perfect"", i think to myself - my phone is waterproof up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. so in my daughter goes, with me in tow with my shiny new z3 compact. now before i went in, i double, triple, quadruple checked that all the seals in my phone were closed. hell, if i bought all those magnetic chargers i sure as hell wasn't going to leave a gate open for water to get in. the phone worked great, i took some pictures and felt like a hero as everyone marveled at my waterproof phone. not that i was in that deep mind you, less than a meter since my daughter couldn't swim and needed the support of my wife and i. mere minutes pass and i feel immense heat coming from my phone, i check it and the screen is black and unresponsive. i exit the pool feeling discombobulated, wonder what was wrong with my phone. i dry the device off and give it a close inspection, mist was building up in the camera lenses, i open the gates and droplets of water begin to  fall out... shit. i'm red faced but that's alright, it's a mass-manufactured device, sometimes these things happen, i'm sure sony will take care of it. so i gave sony a call and arrange for the device to be sent back to an authorised repairer in australia. it's christmas so it will take a few days and luckily i still had my old iphone 5 handy. three weeks later i receive the phone back in the mail with a note saying that it had passed the pressure tests and warranty won't be honoured by sony. i call sony to discuss how this is possible since the gates were closed and water had obviously entered the device, sony will no longer cover the device and have nothing further to comment since it supposedly passed the pressure tests. i have no avenue to appeal or request a second opinion. i fucked up by touting how good the product was and have been left high and dry by the company whose products i was spruiking. during the period that my phone has been out of action, i've missed the opportunity to capture key moments such as my daughter's first steps. now even if i bought another device, i would be afraid to put it near water in the event that it gets waterlogged and pressure testing indicates otherwise. **","The author, an iPhone user, was initially impressed with the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact's features, including its 20.7 megapixel camera, 2,600mAh battery, and waterproof design. He purchased the phone and loved it, even buying one for his father and convincing his father-in-law to buy one too. However, during a trip to the pool with his daughter, the phone's screen became unresponsive and the camera lenses were filled with mist. Despite the author's precautions, water had entered the device. After sending the phone back to Sony for repair, the company refused to honor the warranty, citing that the phone had passed pressure tests. The author was left without a functional phone and felt betrayed by Sony's response, missing out on capturing important moments with his daughter",
51,407,407,17577dd9-1b91-49c4-8e60-5b1b387a186a,genaudit,XSUM,document,model,,,model,,llama3_8b,"The results have been published for more than five million GCSE entries - which will be five million different stories of exam dreams, dramas and disasters. But the overall national picture for GCSE grades is very similar to last year. The proportion getting A* to C grades has nudged up from 68.8% to 69%. That represents an improvement for more than 10,000 exam entries. But the overall message - and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top A* and A grades - is that there is ""stability"". This isn't an accident. The annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate. It's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be. Well, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature. The huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands. There has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils. Add to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards. Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results. He has warned of ""volatility"", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective. ""It is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,"" said Mr Lightman. The lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit? Are there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades? Ofqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system. But it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems. Once there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year. Now there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same. Another factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam. This year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort. There are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the GCSEs early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt. And another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on GCSE maths and English last year are having to re-sit the exam this year. This means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds. But if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Northern Ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%. It raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in Wales. Not only is the Northern Ireland figure far ahead of England, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of England, which was London with 72%. England's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is Northern Ireland that is stretching further ahead. When these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in Northern Ireland are doing much better than anyone else. The scores from the GCSE top grades show the gap. Among entries from female pupils in Northern Ireland, 11.4% achieve A* grades. Among male pupils in Wales, the figure is 4.5%. In England, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest A* grades. This sets a pattern for A-levels and university entry, with Northern Irish women the most likely in the UK to get university places. Whether or not it is going to be consolation for England's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible. Because in a couple of years England's GCSEs will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than A to G, ending a common system with Wales and Northern Ireland. Another curious aside is that many of the pupils taking GCSEs this year in England did not take their Sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott. What difference did it make in the long term? It would take another exam to answer that one.","The UK's GCSE exam results have been published, showing a slight increase in the proportion of students achieving A* to C grades, from 68.8% to 69%. However, the overall picture is one of stability, with no significant changes from last year. The results are the result of a complex balancing act between maintaining standards, preventing grade inflation, and ensuring fairness for individual students. The head of the National Association of Head Teachers has expressed concerns about the reliability of individual results, citing ""volatility"" and sudden dips and spikes in grades.

The results also show regional differences, with Northern Ireland's pupils achieving the highest grades, with 78.7% achieving A* to C grades. This is ahead of England, Wales, and Scotland, and is particularly notable for young women in Northern Ireland, who are achieving higher grades than anywhere else in the UK.

The article also notes that the results are influenced by changes in government policy, such as the introduction of a new grading system for GCSEs, which will replace the current A* to G system with a 9 to 1 system. Additionally, the results are affected by changes in who is taking the exams, such as an older cohort of students and changes in the way that GCSEs are taken.

Overall, the results are a complex and nuanced reflection of the UK's education system, with both positive and negative trends emerging",

lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a

nodule found on a chest X-ray. The doctor reassures Kyle that he will be ""partnering"" with him throughout the process and that he will have a support team around him. Kyle mentions that he has had a cough for about three months, which was initially diagnosed as bronchitis, but the chest X-ray revealed the lung nodule. He also mentions that he has a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has been taking methotrexate to manage it.

The doctor reviews Kyle's medical history and asks about his family history, which reveals that his mother had breast cancer, but is currently doing well. The doctor also asks about any previous history of lung infections or pneumonia, which Kyle denies.

The doctor performs a physical exam and finds that Kyle's vital signs are normal, and his lungs are clear. He also orders a pulmonary function test (PFT) and a PET CT scan to further evaluate the lung nodule.

The doctor explains that the lung nodule is likely to be removed via video-assisted thoracoscopy, which will involve three small incisions on the side of Kyle's right chest. He will be under general anesthesia and will likely be in the hospital for one night.

The doctor also reassures Kyle that he will continue to follow up with his rheumatologist and continue his medication therapy for his RA. Kyle expresses some concerns and fears, but the doctor reassures him that he will be ""right here with him the whole way.""assistant

""i threw an accurate pass to the wr and coach will be proud!!"" i thought. then the offensive line gets up and says, ""didn't he say two?"" i thought, ""yeah i said two?"" so i get back in the huddle, and i asked coach, ""did i do something wrong?"" ""hell yeah!"" he yelled, ""you threw on a run play!"" instantly, i thought i was going to get kicked off the team. the only thing i could do was say, ""i'm so sorry,"" about 30 times. i ended up getting yelled at, told if i do that again, i was being moved to another position, and i got laughed at and made fun of for the rest of the week and still even today by other players and friends. so i quit. i talked to my coach about it and since he knows i want to play guitar and film more, he offered a shot to go back during the fall and actually film the games! then he said if i want to make a career out of it, he could call his good friend from south carolina to possibly get me scholarship money to go down there and film the games.","The writer, a quarterback, shares a story about their first day of spring practice.

The financial services firm said new rules, coming into effect next May, could see fines soar to 20m euros (£17.4m) or more. Fines for data breaches had already risen, from 18 in 2015, to 35 in 2016, amounting to £3.2m in total, said PwC. There were also 23 enforcement notices, where organisations were required to improve compliance - a 155% increase. According to PwC's research, the UK is one of the most active places in Europe for regulatory enforcement in this area, along with Italy. Penalties issued by the UK Information Commissioner's Office in 2016 included a record £400,000 fine for telecoms firm TalkTalk over security failings that allowed a cyber attacker to access customer data ""with ease"". In 2015 the online pharmacy Pharmacy 2U was also told to pay £130,000 after it sold details of more than 20,000 customers to marketing companies without their consent. However, PwC said that when the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becomes law across the EU next May, firms would face much tougher obligations and penalties. In particular, the Information Commissioner's Office will be able to issue fines of up to 4% of global turnover, or 20m euros - whichever is highest. The regulator can only issues fines of up to £500,000 at present. ""UK organisations must use the remaining time to prepare for GDPR compliance before May next year,"" said Stewart Room, an expert in global cybersecurity and data protection at PwC. The UK is due to adopt the new rules before it leaves the EU, but PwC said it was unlikely to water down the protections after it left the union.","PwC has warned that companies must prepare for new, tougher EU data protection rules or face significant fines. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will come into effect in May 2018, introducing stricter obligations and penalties. Fines can reach up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover, a significant increase from the current maximum fine of £500,000. The UK Information Commissioner's Office has already issued fines and enforcement notices, with a 155% increase in enforcement notices in 2016. PwC advises UK organizations to prepare for GDPR compliance before the deadline, as it is unlikely that the UK will water down the protections after leaving the EU",

He presents with an upper respiratory infection, feeling tired, short of breath, and experiencing joint pain. He has had both COVID-19 vaccines and has not had any history of seasonal allergies. The doctor assesses Andrew's symptoms and performs a physical exam, noting scattered ronchi bilaterally on his lung exam and some edema of his lower extremities. The doctor reviews Andrew's chest X-ray and diabetic labs, finding no signs of pneumonia or airspace disease, but noting an elevated hemoglobin A1c level. The doctor diagnoses Andrew with a viral syndrome and plans to send a COVID-19 test to rule out COVID-19. The doctor also advises Andrew to continue monitoring his blood sugar levels and blood pressure at home, and to take his medication as prescribed",

""It gives me a lot of confidence and a lot of good friends,"" says one of the players on a five-a-side football pitch in the north of Glasgow. He's moving around nimbly on crutches, putting everything into the training and drills. There are shouts for the ball, plenty of laughter but lots of hard work. After all some of the players here have their next competitive game in just over a week. Many of them do play on crutches, others with prosthetic limbs. The sport of amputee football has been going for many years south of the border and now a charity is now trying to form a Scotland-wide league. It is holding the first amputee football Scottish Cup in Edinburgh next month. This team I am watching is linked to Partick Thistle. ""I wish, looking back, I hadn't let it stop me,"" says Brian Murray, who lost his leg to cancer at the age of 10. He says that, although as a youngster he did play on crutches with his pals, when he went to secondary school he lost confidence and began wearing his prosthetic leg all the time. His introduction to amputee football was in England, regularly travelling to Everton to get a game. It is rough at times - he broke his collarbone last year, but did not let that put him off. He describes the sport now being in Scotland as ""brilliant"". ""That's what I want to give to youngsters,"" he says. ""Don't let anyone stop you, just go for it."" He adds that if he is still playing at the age of 47, then ""it doesn't matter what age you are"". Amputee football is played all over the world. In Turkey, for instance, there is a professional league, aired on television with 600 players. Scotland is hoping to play some friendlies against other European countries later in the year. ""Amputee football is just about getting people out and playing football,"" says Ashley Reid of the Amputee Football Association Scotland (AFAS). ""The limb difference, the amputation is not relevant at all when people are here training. It's just about playing football."" She says she saw a clear demand for the sport in Scotland. The task now is to try to spread out across the country. In among the men on the pitch is one woman. In fact, she is the only woman playing in the amputee football league in the UK. ""All amputees are used to being the odd one out in the crowd,"" Rebecca Sellar explains. ""So coming into this as the only woman, you get on with it and over it."" She would like to get more women involved. Rebecca says that since she started she has been welcomed into the game and on a personal level has gained fitness as well as the enjoyment of taking part in a team sport. She says: ""Our numbers are growing and the more word we can get out there to encourage people to get involved the better we can have it as a sport for Scotland.""","Amputee football is a growing sport globally, but it is still in its infancy in Scotland. A charity is working to establish a Scotland-wide league and is hosting the first amputee football Scottish Cup in Edinburgh next month. The sport is not limited to men, with one woman, Rebecca Sellar, currently the only female player in the UK league. Despite the challenges, players like Brian Murray, who lost his leg to cancer at a young age, are passionate about the sport and want to encourage others to join. The Amputee Football Association Scotland (AFAS) aims to spread the sport across the country and is planning friendlies against other European countries later this year. The organization's goal is to get people playing football, regardless of their limb difference or amputation, and to provide a sense of community and fitness for those involved",
68,538,538,0a781386-e125-4ae5-99b6-320e80600b5d,genaudit,XSUM,document,model,,,model,,llama3_8b,"In the Scottish Football Association's statement of Thursday evening, there is no mention of money and the kind of cash it would have taken to bring to an end the reign of Gordon Strachan as national team manager. That's hardly a surprise. These things are never made public. Removing Strachan and his coaches and finding replacements would have meant a serious hit to the coffers of an association that has routinely failed to benefit from the millions of euros on offer to those nations who qualify for major championships. Money was not brought up in the statement, but it's inconceivable that it didn't play a part in the discussion. Why pay when the World Cup campaign is already on life support? Why not accept your fate of another doomed mission, let him see out of his deal, save the cash and make a change if one needs to be made when the group fixtures are completed? The SFA couldn't say any of this. It couldn't say it was unwilling, or unable, to pay off the manager, so a different narrative was delivered in its statement, a narrative of ""jam tomorrow"". In this optimistic view of the world, all that was missing was a complimentary pair of pom-poms. All hope of a play-off spot for the World Cup is not lost, they say. They're clinging to the belief that Scotland can garner enough points from a remaining available total of 18 to force their way into the reckoning when the evidence of everybody's eyes tell us otherwise. Presenting a scenario of Scotland reeling off win after win required a fair amount of chutzpah for an association that has watched its team concede seven goals in three winless games. And that on top of two years without a competitive win against anybody other than Malta and Gibraltar. Stewart Regan, the SFA's chief executive, is quoted on how adamant Strachan is about his team's capacity to make up ground in the group. How? He doesn't say. Regan points out that the board is convinced that Strachan still has the ""hunger for the challenge"". Hunger shouldn't have anything to do with it when you've failed to qualify for the most easily accessible Euros in history and then sit fifth out of six in a World Cup qualification group with your dreams going up in a puff of smoke. Scotland will limp on now until March, when they host Slovenia at Hampden. Will we hear again that Slovenia is not a must-win? Will we see anything different? Will any new players be considered? Will there be any thoughts about a new formation? Is there likely to be any acknowledgement that, if Scotland keep doing the same things, they are going to end up with the same results? There was no hint of that in Strachan's words in the SFA statement on Thursday. No acceptance that, if he's staying on, he needs to have a major think about what he is doing, who's he selecting and not selecting. If he had spoken about a new beginning then you might - might - be inclined to buy into it. Is he even thinking about it that way? You would hope so, but it's unlikely. There is so much to ponder. Does Scotland have to follow a slavish adherence to 4-2-3-1? Can a solution be found to the absence of dominant centre-backs by converting a full-back or a midfielder? Maybe not, but where are the ideas? We saw a snapshot of Strachan's out-of-the-box thinking when he played Ikechi Anya at right-back at Wembley. What happens when Kieran Tierney and Andrew Robertson are both fit at left-back, along with Lee Wallace and Stephen Kingsley? Is it really one from four there? Does it have to be that way? Where's the innovation, the sense of a manager trying something a bit different? And what about an enhanced cast of characters on the scene? Aberdeen's Graeme Shinnie, Fulham's Tom Cairney, Brighton's Jamie Murphy, Aston Villa's Ross McCormack, Stoke City's Phil Bardsley and, yes, if he ever starts playing and scoring again, Middlesbrough's Jordan Rhodes. There are others, either on the periphery of the squad or totally divorced from it, that could be looked at properly. Too often, Strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it's done nothing for the team. The tired mantra that ""the players are just not there"" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that Scotland become truly competitive, like Northern Ireland. They have decent Premier League centre-halves - from West Brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from Southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth. And yet, from a squad largely made up of Championship, League One and Scottish Premiership players, Northern Ireland get the kind of results that are beyond Scotland. The attitude of ""no manager could do better with these players"" is fatalism. It's tantamount to a white flag being raised. A quitter's charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what Michael O'Neill is doing with his meagre resources in Belfast. The SFA's statement on Thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of Hampden. When they can't get a draw against Georgia, can't beat Lithuania and can't avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like Slovakia, the idea of Scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell. Scotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.","The Scottish Football Association (SFA) has announced the departure of Gordon Strachan as national team manager, but the reasons behind the decision remain unclear. The SFA's statement did not mention money, but it is likely that financial considerations played a role in the decision. The article suggests that the SFA may have been unwilling or unable to pay off Strachan's contract, which would have been a significant expense. The article also criticizes the SFA's optimistic view of the team's chances of qualifying for the World Cup, which is seen as unrealistic given the team's recent performances. The article also questions the team's tactics and player selection, suggesting that Strachan's rigid approach has not been effective. The article concludes that the SFA's decision to keep Strachan on is a sign of a lack of ambition and a willingness to accept failure",

They enlisted the help of their stepfather, who pointed out a square box under the truck as the oil reservoir. The writer drained the oil, replaced the filter, and added new oil, but noticed that the engine was idling low. The next day, they checked the oil level and found it to be extremely high, and then proceeded to drive the truck, noticing unusual behavior such as slow acceleration and difficulty shifting gears. After driving only 6 miles, the writer realized something was seriously wrong and called a mechanic, who informed them that they had drained the transmission fluid instead of the engine oil. The writer was told not to start the engine again and to have the truck towed to the shop for repairs, which ended up costing $4,000 and requiring a new transmission. The writer acknowledges their mistake and is sharing their experience as a cautionary tale",

The patient, Cheryl, reports experiencing back pain after walking for 30 minutes to an hour a day for the past six days. She describes the pain as a sudden spasm or clenching in her lower back, which is still stiff and painful despite taking ibuprofen and applying heat. The doctor asks about any trauma or strenuous activities before the pain started, and Cheryl mentions lifting weights three times a week, possibly using her back more than her legs. The doctor examines the patient's back and finds pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of the lumbar spine, as well as pain with flexion and extension. The doctor orders an x-ray and lab tests, which show no signs of fracture or infection. The doctor diagnoses the patient with a lumbar strain and prescribes meloxicam to help with the pain. The doctor also refers the patient to physical therapy to strengthen her back muscles.

Jacqueline is surprised and anxious about the diagnosis, as she has never been told she had the virus before. The doctor asks about Jacqueline's medical history, including her use of IV drugs and hepatitis C-positive partners, and she reveals that she used to use IV drugs 15 years ago but has been clean since then. The doctor also asks about her current habits, including her smoking and drinking habits, and Jacqueline reports that she has cut down on both.

The doctor reviews Jacqueline's medical history and finds that she has no other known medical conditions, except for hypertension, diabetes, and depression, which run in her family. The doctor performs a physical exam and finds that Jacqueline's vital signs are normal, and she has no signs of jaundice or liver disease.

The doctor explains that the hepatitis C diagnosis is confirmed by the patient's blood work, and that the next step is to determine the severity of the liver disease and the best course of treatment. The doctor orders additional blood work, including a test for hepatitis C RNA and a liver ultrasound, to determine the severity of the liver disease.

The doctor also advises Jacqueline to have her family members, including her wife and children, tested for hepatitis C, as they may be at risk of contracting the virus. The doctor schedules a follow-up appointment for Jacqueline in three weeks and has the nurse check her out and schedule the additional blood work and ultrasound",

Don't insult the object of your desire with promises you both know you can't keep. If you lack the cash for that magnificent bunch of fragrant roses, resist the temptation to brandish a fraying fake bouquet instead. There has to be a better alternative, and you're unlikely to get a positive response. And as for trying to bully or force someone into partnership with you - a little tip: it's unlikely to go down well. In this respect, the EU makes a lousy suitor. After reeling in panic and reacting in slow motion to the - to an extent predicted - dramatic surge this year in refugees and other migrants arriving, the EU is now trying a more comprehensive, strategic approach. It includes an attempt to persuade (woo/push) the migrants' countries of origin, or the transit countries, to: Migration to Europe explained in graphics The EU also plans to send cash and other aid ""over there"", in the hope of dissuading more refugees and others from wanting to reach Europe, risking their lives. A rather similar formula worked for Spain several years ago when it was the main EU arrival point for people smugglers' boats. Bilateral deals with Morocco and Mauritania significantly reduced the arrival of ""pateras"", as Spaniards nicknamed those boats. But Spain came under fire from aid organisations (NGOs) at the time for trying to make African countries the ""gatekeepers of Europe"". The NGOs also raised concerns about possible human rights abuses against would-be migrants blocked at the border. They complained that the bilateral agreements, sorely lacking in transparency, smacked more of backroom deals. Similar concerns are now being directed at the EU as a whole. This week, the EU hosted a summit in Malta with African nations, in the hope of coming to an ""understanding"" on slowing the flow of migrants to Europe. But, in addition to NGO concerns (such as the risk of groups linked to human rights abuses, like the Eritrean security forces, siphoning off money allocated to stop migrants), African leaders widely dismissed EU offers of cash and other aid, as far too little to tackle the root causes of migration. As flowers go, the extra aid package doesn't even make the gaudy plastic category. The EU offered €3.6bn ($3.9bn; £2.5bn) to improve life in a number of African countries. This in addition to the €20bn it already gives in aid to Africa. Somalia's distinctly unimpressed Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke put it to the BBC that Africa needed investment, not charity, to improve its economies. The same as the US, the EU or anywhere else in the world, he said. In fact, EU countries couldn't even muster the pledged extra cash. It's a promise they seem unable or unwilling to keep. The European Commission says it will put in €1.8bn and wants the rest of the new fund made up by individual European nations. So far they've coughed up less than €80m. The EU was also unable to persuade/charm - some say bully - African countries into automatically receiving deported migrants back. Instead, in the written summit conclusions, the EU was forced to emphasise ""voluntary repatriations"". That prompted obvious questions about the bloc's declared aim of ""speeding up the return"" of economic migrants and other failed asylum seekers - a key part of its plan to tackle the migrant crisis. In short: the summit was not a resounding success. And a number of European newspapers were critical of the EU even trying to make a deal. Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung says the EU's offer of money to reduce the refugee numbers from Africa could open the EU to accusations of ""showing its real values by co-operating with unjust regimes"". Similar objections are raised when it comes to EU attempts to strike a deal with Turkey - now the main departure point for refugees and other migrants crossing to Europe. EU leaders are planning a Turkey summit before the end of the year, but - as German Chancellor Angela Merkel has pointed out - ""Ankara holds the cards"". And diplomats worry that Ankara will demand an extravagant bouquet in terms of money and political concessions - such as lifting visa restrictions, and accelerating Turkey's EU membership bid - in exchange for help on migration. And again, critics challenge the EU for courting Turkey at all - a country with an imperious president and dismal human rights record. There are also those who say the EU's focus is far too fixed on creating ""Fortress Europe"", on keeping people out and not on introducing legal ways for them to come to over. Because come they will. The European Commission expects about three million refugees and other migrants to arrive in Europe by 2017. Clearly, whatever the EU does during this crisis, it will come under fire from some quarter or another. All too often, it comes up against itself - a behemoth of 28 nations, struggling to work together. Even the quota system - accepted (reluctantly) by most EU countries - to share out more equally the asylum seekers in Europe is an unmitigated flop so far. Agreed number of people to be relocated: 160,000. People moved to date: 147. Cross-border co-operation is disintegrating as barbed wire goes up and borders slam shut across Europe: in Slovenia, Hungary, Austria, Sweden, Norway… Even Germany is toughening border regulations. In stark contrast to the warm welcome given to hundreds or thousands earlier this autumn, Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's hugely popular finance minister, has begun to mutter darkly about a migrant ""avalanche"" engulfing his country. There's little evidence of the EU - more of each country for itself. That prompted the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, to warn that Schengen, the EU agreement allowing passport-free travel across much of Europe, risks collapse. Yet it is one of the EU's proudest achievements. You could argue Schengen has already wilted and died.","The European Union's efforts to address the migrant crisis are being criticized for being ineffective and lacking transparency. The EU is trying to persuade African countries to take back deported migrants and is offering aid to improve life in those countries. However, African leaders are dismissing the offers as insufficient and lacking in transparency. The EU's plan to send cash and aid to African countries to dissuade migrants from coming to Europe is also being met with skepticism. The EU's focus on creating ""Fortress Europe"" and keeping people out is being criticized, with some arguing that the EU should instead focus on introducing legal ways for migrants to come to Europe. The EU's quota system for sharing asylum seekers among member states is also being criticized for being ineffective, with only 147 people relocated out of an agreed 160,000. The situation is causing tensions among EU member states, with some countries tightening their borders and others criticizing the EU's approach. The President of the European Council has warned that the Schengen agreement, which allows passport-free travel across much of Europe, risks collapse",

[doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . [doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [patient_guest] okay . [doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . [patient_guest] okay . okay . [doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough . [patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it . [doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .","The doctor sees a patient, Randy Gutierrez, who is 8 months old and has been feeling sick for a day. Randy's symptoms include a runny nose, congestion, and a cough that is not barky. He also has a low-grade fever of 100.3°F and has been pulling on his ears and rubbing his nose. His mother reports that he has been irritable and has trouble sleeping.

The doctor performs a physical exam and finds that Randy's ears are normal. The doctor diagnoses Randy with a viral infection and advises his mother to continue using saline mist in his nose and to keep him hydrated with fluids. The doctor also recommends watching Randy closely for a barky cough, which could indicate a more severe infection.

The doctor prescribes a medication for Randy's sister, who has a sinus infection, and gives Randy some of the same medication to take if he develops a barky cough. The doctor also recommends using Zarbee's cough syrup for Randy's regular cough, but advises using the dose for children under a year of age.

The doctor schedules a follow-up appointment for Randy in one week and advises his mother to continue monitoring his symptoms and to seek medical attention if he shows any signs of worsening",

noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe [patient] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on [doctor] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation [patient] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse [doctor] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising [patient] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the [doctor] in my on the side of my vision [patient] okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face [doctor] no i have n't [patient] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running [doctor] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics [patient] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike [doctor] okay [patient] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike [doctor] hmmm [patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise [doctor] it is [patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri [doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri [patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about [doctor] okay [patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here [doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal [doctor] okay go ahead sorry [patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me [doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery [patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment [doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week [patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri [doctor] okay alright thank you bye [patient] bye sorry,"The patient, Julie, visits a doctor due to frequent and severe headaches, which have been occurring more often and intensely in recent times. She has a history of headaches, particularly during her menstrual periods, but has also experienced them when stressed. The doctor notes that Julie's headaches are mostly on her right side, behind her eye, and feel like a pulsing sensation.

Julie also reports experiencing ringing in her ears and blurred vision, particularly on the side of her vision. She has not experienced numbness or tingling in her hands, feet, or face. The doctor asks about Julie's exercise habits and notes that she has been trying to exercise more to lose weight, but her headaches worsen when she exercises.

The doctor suspects that Julie may have idiopathic intracranial hypertension, a condition characterized by increased pressure in the brain without a known cause. The doctor recommends an MRI to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. She also suggests a spinal tap to evaluate the pressure in the brain and potentially relieve symptoms.

The doctor explains that treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension may involve medication to decrease pressure in the brain, as well as lifestyle changes such as exercise and weight loss. She notes that surgery is not necessarily required and that Julie will need to undergo further testing and evaluation before a treatment plan is developed. The doctor's team will work with Julie's insurance company to obtain preapproval for the MRI and schedule the test",

has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem [patient] well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking [doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing [patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down [doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that [patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids [doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that [patient] it's really just about solids [doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all [patient] no [doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all [patient] not that i want [doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this [patient] no [doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going [patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise [doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all [patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time [doctor] and how are the numbers looking [patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting [doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that [patient] no [doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home [patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range [doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that [patient] no that sounds great [doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that [patient] no [doctor] okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything [patient] you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great [doctor] okay sure i'll get you a refill for norvasc we'll get that sent over to the pharmacy okay [patient] thank you [doctor] alright thanks good seeing you thanks for coming in to them,"The patient, a 56-year-old male, presents with a 4-5 week history of difficulty swallowing, particularly with solid foods. He describes a sensation of something being stuck in his throat, which can be painful and requires him to wash it down with liquids. He has not experienced any coughing, vomiting, or blood in his stool or vomit. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure, which are well-controlled with metformin and norvasc, respectively.

The doctor examines the patient and finds no abnormalities in his neck, thyroid, or throat. The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, and his hemoglobin A1c is 7.4. The doctor suspects a narrowing in the patient's esophagus, possibly due to a stricture, and recommends a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and possible dilation.

The doctor also orders a repeat hemoglobin A1c test and additional blood work to check kidney function. The patient is started on prilosec, a reflux medication, and is advised to chew his food more frequently to prevent food from getting stuck in his throat. The doctor also gives the patient an eye referral to ophthalmology to check for diabetic retinopathy.

The patient is scheduled to return in a month for follow-up, and the doctor reminds him to continue taking his medications as prescribed. The patient is also reminded to refill his norvasc prescription, which is running low",

She reports that she has been doing well since the last visit, with her prednisone dose decreased to one pill per day. She occasionally takes an extra pill when experiencing pain in her feet, which is exacerbated by her desk job. The doctor notes that this is acceptable and plans to discontinue the prednisone altogether.

The patient also discusses her methotrexate treatment, which she believes has helped with her joint pain. However, she experienced side effects after missing a dose while getting her COVID-19 vaccine, including severe pain. The doctor advises her to continue taking the medication as directed.

The patient also expresses concern about frequent bruising, which the doctor attributes to the prednisone. She is advised to discontinue the medication and monitor the bruising.

During the physical examination, the doctor checks the patient's joints and finds that they are still experiencing some pain, but notes that her range of motion is good. The doctor also notes the ridges in her nails, which are a symptom of her psoriasis.

The doctor concludes that the patient's treatment is progressing well and plans to discontinue the prednisone and continue with the methotrexate. She schedules an appointment for blood work and advises the patient to return in three months",

[doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ? [patient] yeah , my ankles swell . [doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ? [patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times . [doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ? [patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds . [doctor] mm-hmm . okay . [patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year . [doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ? [patient] no . [doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ? [patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication . [doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ? [patient] i'm not really sure . [doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ? [patient] yeah , you name it . [doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ? [patient] yes . [doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ? [patient] it was actually my son , not my brother . [doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment . [patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well . [doctor] okay , i see . [patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family . [doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ? [patient] correct . [doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam . [patient] all right . sounds good . [doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ? [patient] no , i feel fine . [doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam . [patient] okay . [doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working . [patient] okay .","The document is a new patient note for Diana Scott, a 100-year-old woman who was referred to the doctor due to a newly diagnosed heart murmur. During the consultation, the doctor asked Diana about her symptoms, which included severe leg pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Diana reported that she had been experiencing these symptoms for about a month, and that they were worse when she overexerted herself. She also mentioned that she had been taking pain pills for her leg pain and had noticed a 20-pound weight loss over the past year.

The doctor asked Diana about her medical history, including her family history, and noted that her son had a heart attack, her brother had a stroke due to sugar diabetes, and her eldest sister had a heart problem. The doctor also asked about Diana's medication regimen and noted that she was taking multiple medications, including pain pills for her leg pain.

The doctor performed a physical exam and scheduled Diana for an echocardiogram to further evaluate her heart murmur. The doctor also asked Diana to return for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the test and to develop a plan for managing her symptoms and heart condition",

The aim is to learn more about the behaviour of a species that experts say could cause millions of pounds of damage to crops if left untreated. Usually, if you want to study an animal, you do a survey and count it. The problem with slugs is you can't always see them as they spend much of their time out of sight in the top 10cm (4in) of the ground. But improved tracking technology will allow scientists to accurately follow slug movements for the first time. The aim of the research is to answer an interesting problem facing farmers: how do slugs live amongst their crops? The researchers at Harper Adams University have a theory slugs are not evenly distributed over a field. Instead they believe they are concentrated in patches. That's important because if the scientists could help farmers find these large patches of slugs you could target them with pest control measures. That would be cheaper and greener than spreading chemicals over an entire field. Slugs are slimy and enjoy squeezing into tight spaces so the trackers need to be placed inside the slugs themselves just under the skin. The slugs are anaesthetised before a small cut is made in the skin and the tracker inserted. The tracker itself is smaller than a grain of rice. The slugs I saw were implanted a month ago and seemed happy. It's important to the researchers that the trackers don't cause the slugs to behave any differently to their non-implanted cousins. In the lab it appears neither slug movement or appetite is affected. Tracking the slugs involves equipment that looks very like a metal detector. Researchers will go out at night when the slugs are most active and release the slugs with the trackers. There will be hundreds of them over the duration of the experiment. Then every 20 minutes throughout the night the team will scan the fields with the detector. This will automatically log the slug's individual tracker number and it's GPS location building up a very accurate map of where the slugs go and what they are doing. There's increasing pressure on farmers to reduce the chemicals they use against slugs and some are being banned outright. So if this research comes up with a better way to control them by revealing more about their behaviour it could be very useful. Funding for this study has come from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), The Potato Council and Cereals and Oilseeds who estimate that slugs could cause Â£100m of damage to UK crops if they aren't properly controlled. And finally a confession. We did take a slug out into the field and we put it down on the ground to track it. We certainly managed to find it again, the signal from its tracker was loud and strong, but we couldn't actually see it. Which means we couldn't recover the slug and he had to go and join his colleagues in the soil. It did rather show how trackers beat traditional visual slug surveys. And soon our slug implanted with a tracker will be joined by hundreds more. Update: One week on and our slug was safely recovered by the team.","Researchers at Harper Adams University are tracking slugs to better understand their behavior and develop more effective methods for controlling them. Slugs can cause significant damage to crops, estimated to be around £100m in the UK, and are difficult to study due to their underground habits. The team is using small tracking devices, smaller than a grain of rice, to monitor the slugs' movements and habits. The devices are implanted under the skin of the slugs, which are then released into fields at night. The researchers use a metal detector-like device to scan the fields and track the slugs' movements, building a map of their behavior. The goal is to identify areas where slugs are concentrated, allowing farmers to target pest control measures more effectively and reduce the use of chemicals.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said he and Mr Trump agreed to pull the vote, after it became apparent it would not get the minimum of 215 Republican votes needed. The last minute move was seen as a huge blow to Mr Trump. Repealing and replacing the programme known as Obamacare was one of his major election pledges. Earlier on Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the vote would go ahead at 15:30 (19:30 GMT). Mr Trump had reportedly warned Republicans that if they did not vote for his bill then they would be stuck with Barack Obama's healthcare programme for good. However, multiple reports suggested that between 28 and 35 Republicans were opposed to his draft American Health Care Act. The vote was withdrawn shortly after 15:30, and the House is now in recess. Republicans currently have a majority in both the House and the Senate. However, some Republicans were unhappy that the bill cut health coverage too severely, while others felt the changes did not go far enough. The bill also appeared unpopular with the public - in one recent poll, just 17% approved of it. Speaking after the withdrawal, Mr Trump blamed the Democrats for not supporting the bill and predicted that Obamacare would ""explode"". He said the Republicans would probably focus on tax reform for now. ""We have to let Obamacare go its own way for a little while,"" he said, adding that if the Democrats were ""civilised and came together"" the two parties could work out a ""great healthcare bill"". How bad was Friday's defeat of the American Health Care Act in the House of Representatives? Bad. Very bad. The American Health Care Act was the first major piece of legislation pushed by the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress, a key political test early in the president's term, when he should be at the height of his power and party cohesion at its strongest. In spite of all of this, Mr Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republicans running Washington could not get the job done. For Republicans Friday wasn't just bad. It was a disaster. Read more analysis here. Earlier, Mr Ryan told reporters: ""We are going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future. ""I will not sugar coat this. This is a disappointing day for us. Doing big things is hard."" ""We were a 10-year opposition party where being against things was easy to do,"" he said, adding that it was difficult to get ""people to agree with each other in how we do things"". Meanwhile, Democrat and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi described it as ""a victory for the American people"". And House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said it was a ""good day"" for Americans, adding ""we worked over years to assure that the American public would have access to affordable, quality healthcare"".","US President Donald Trump has withdrawn his healthcare bill, the American Health Care Act, after it failed to gain enough support to pass in Congress.
