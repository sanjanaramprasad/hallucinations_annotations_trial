Citizens Advice Scotland said the number of employment cases it had seen had risen by 12% in the last four years and was  now at its highest level. It said the most common issues involved low pay, withheld wages and unfair dismissal, as well as bullying and discrimination. CAS has highlighted the issues in a report to MSPs. Holyrood's Economy, Energy and Tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession. CAS said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in Scotland. Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials. Delivering the report to the Scottish Parliament, the charity's spokesman Rob Gowans said:  ""What our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the Scottish CAB (Citizen Advice Bureaux) service over the last few years. ""While we don't give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience. There is a growing crisis of low pay and poor conditions in Scotland. ""Around half of Scots who are in poverty are actually working. This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut. He added: ""With wages falling in real terms, families are becoming trapped in poverty, less secure terms and working hours, and with basic employment rights becoming harder to enforce."" Mr Gowans also raised concerns about ""too many rogue employers"" who were ""exploiting"" workers under this environment. ""The growth in zero hours contracts has become a huge problem, which leaves thousands of Scots in huge financial uncertainty. And meanwhile it is becoming harder than ever to challenge unfair treatment,"" he added.

with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing

had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright great,"[doctor] hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that

Services from Aberystwyth to Birmingham and Milford Haven to Manchester via Cardiff, are among routes which could be affected.

You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight. But Shakespeare's Globe on London's Bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers. Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics The Globe's site beside the River Thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor Jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse. Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself. Farah Karim-Cooper, one of the Globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources. The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"". But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says Dr Karim-Cooper. The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences. ""We're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says. But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice. Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre? It was something that happened regularly in Shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor Globe to an indoor playhouse such as the Blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the River Thames. It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub. The Globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight. The Globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light. And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles. Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era. ""Darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says Dr Karim-Cooper. ""Darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick. It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there."" She says that if Elizabethans or Jacobeans travelled in time to modern London ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"". Another big difference is that Shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage. The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown. In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen. The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors. And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed Globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play. ""It was a very social occasion,"" says Dr Karim-Cooper, describing the Shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing. ""Contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says. Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed. For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says Dr Karim-Cooper. Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue. When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment. There are other big changes between a modern and Shakespearean theatre visit. It would have smelled very different, says Dr Karim-Cooper. There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together. Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says. It would have been a much softer sound, as Elizabethan London didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music. ""In terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says. ""There are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming. They never heard a plane taking off."" The language would have sounded unusual too. The accent of the time would have meant words such as ""move"" and ""love"" would have sounded much closer to rhyming. And the Globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation. The role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors. ""There is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do. It wouldn't work,"" says Dr Karim-Cooper. Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions. They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days. ""We want to get beyond Wikipedia,"" she says. She is co-editor of Moving Shakespeare Indoors, a collection of essays on indoor Jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the Globe's work. There is a postgraduate degree course in Shakespeare Studies with King's College, London. There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers. Every year there is a landmark schools production, the Playing Shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for London pupils. It's been a huge success, with many  coming to see Shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before. Dr Karim-Cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory. ""We want to become a research hub. We want students to be here."" The ""unique blend"" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the ""literary rigour"".

14,119,119,5fa72656-e156-403d-8f79-9a761e26cb59,genaudit,XSUM,document,model,,,model,,llama3_8b,"England failed to build on the optimism generated by their thrilling victory in Germany as they were beaten in a friendly by the Netherlands, who have not even qualified for Euro 2016. On a night when Wembley paid its respects to the late Dutch legend Johan Cruyff with applause in the 14th minute, a much-changed England side slipped to a rare defeat at the national stadium. Man-of-the-match Jamie Vardy rounded off a slick passing move to steer in Kyle Walker's cross four minutes before the interval - but Roy Hodgson's side could not protect their lead. England's defence lived on the edge too often and were eventually punished when a sloppy passage of play led to Danny Rose handling, and Vincent Janssen scored from the spot after 50 minutes. The big striker was then too strong for substitute Phil Jagielka, although England complained bitterly he had been fouled, before crossing for Luciano Narsingh to score the winner 13 minutes from  time. Vardy's transition from the heights he has scaled with Leicester City this season to England has been seamless - and he has stepped up a level in the two friendlies against Germany and the Netherlands. The 29-year-old has been portrayed as both an ideal starter and the perfect impact substitute as Hodgson makes plans for Euro 2016. Vardy has proved his capabilities for both, with an explosive 20-minute cameo in Berlin that included a brilliantly instinctive finish as part of England's comeback. And here, he was England's outstanding performer by some distance, showing the pace and energy that has panicked Premier League defences and also skill to round off that passing move with a clinical finish before testing Dutch keeper Jeroen Zoet with a powerful rising drive. The debate about how best to use Vardy may go on but one thing is beyond dispute - he is going to Euro 2016 and has the ability to threaten every defence in France. In an ideal world, Everton's John Stones would have come in at Wembley to produce the sort of elegant display that became his trademark in the early seasons of his career, thus cementing his place alongside Chris Smalling for England's first Euro 2016 game against Russia in Marseille. Instead, Wembley witnessed a 21-year-old whose confidence has been hit by a recent dip in form at club level and will need a little renovating before the serious action gets under way. Stones twice brought murmurs of concern from England's fans inside Wembley with his tendency to perhaps over-play out of defence, but his determination to be constructive also started the passing move that led to Vardy's goal. The young defender is a work in progress and there will be slips - quite literally when he stumbled at the start of a chain of events that led to England keeper Fraser Forster having to save well from Janssen before Rose handled to leave the striker to score from the spot. Stones is well worth persevering with - but Hodgson must hope some of that confidence and composure returns quickly. Hodgson warned they must not get carried away after victory in Germany - and, in case anyone ignored the warning, along comes a defeat against a Dutch team that will not even be in France this summer. In some respects this defeat, albeit with a much-changed side, simply reinforced some of the lessons that came out of the win in Germany that was the catalyst for such a surge of optimism. England have some very exciting options up front in the shape of Vardy and Harry Kane, while Daniel Sturridge also got a decent 57 minutes under his belt. Questions remain, however, about a frail-looking defence with both full-back spots still up for grabs and no central-defensive pairing jumping out as Hodgson's first choice at this stage. England certainly carry a threat but fears persist about their ability to resist attacks of the highest calibre. Fraser Forster: Solid night for the Southampton keeper despite a couple of fumbles. Saved well from Georginio Wijnaldum and Vincent Janssen. Clear deputy to Joe Hart. 7. Kyle Walker: Solid and quick in defence and a threat in attack with a perfect pass for Vardy to score England's goal. 7. Chris Smalling: Part of an uncertain central-defensive partnership that once again hinted at England's frailty against attacks possessing real quality. 6. John Stones: Not a great night for Everton's 21-year-old. Yes, his determination to play started the move for England's goal but too often caused anxiety with his tendency to overdo things and second-half slip started chain of events that led to the Dutch equaliser. 5. Danny Rose: Not an easy night for England's defence but Rose kept going and may consider himself unlucky to be punished for the handball that led to a penalty. 6. James Milner: Anonymous as England's captain. Milner is a solid presence but not big on inspirational moments. 5. Danny Drinkwater: Solid debut from the Leicester City midfielder. Did himself no harm and can be happy with his debut but did he make a compelling case for inclusion in Euro 2016? Not sure. 6. Ross Barkley: Busy first half and a trademark second-half surge that set up a chance for Adam Lallana. 6. Adam Lallana: Decent night for the Liverpool midfielder. Clever pass played its part in England's goal and was warmly applauded when substituted. 7. Daniel Sturridge: Once he'd stopped fiddling with his bootlaces he settled down and produced one or two moments that hint at the threat he could yet pose for England. 6. Jamie Vardy: England's star man. Busy, scored one and could have had another. 8. Substitutes: Walcott (for Sturridge, 57 minutes): Odd flash of pace and one rising shot over the bar but otherwise quiet. 6. Clyne (for Rose, 57 minutes): Not much of an opportunity and consequently not much impact. 5. Kane (for Lallana, 70 minutes): Just a couple of half-chances but no rescue act from the man who is now England's first-choice striker. 5. Jagielka (for Smalling, 70 minutes): Claimed he was fouled by Janssen in the lead-up to the winner but should have been stronger in that situation. 5. Alli (for Milner, 82 minutes): No rating. Dier (for Drinkwater, 84 minutes): No rating. The Three Lions wait until 21 May to host Turkey, while Netherlands meet Republic of Ireland six days later. Match ends, England 1, Netherlands 2.

[patient] yes , that's correct . it was icy , and i have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house . i stepped and my feet just went out . fell on my left side . seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt . it's been hurting since . [doctor] yeah , that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms . anything seem to make the pain worse ? [patient] well , i've always hit the gym and lifted weights . i've been trying to keep with my routine of two days a week , but it's been hard . the pain is worse when i lift , and i have n't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds which is very frustrating . [doctor] mm-hmm . i can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine . [patient] exactly . i really enjoy my exercise , but over the past one to two weeks , i've stopped hitting the gym because the pain just was n't worth it honestly . i do keep up with my walking , though . my wife and i walk about 30 minutes almost every day . we have done this since i retired from my office job last year . [doctor] i do not blame you , mr . james . does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried ? [patient] not too much . i have iced a bit , but i have not taken anything for the pain . stopping exercise and some ice has helped a bit , but it still hurts enough for me to come to see you . [doctor] yeah , okay . how about any numbness or tingling ? have you felt that at any point ? [patient] no , doc . just pain . no tingling or numbless , numbness , thankfully .

[patient] i like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it does n't help . i am not opposed to a shot but would like to try the therapy first .

healing is that right [patient] yes [doctor] so can you tell me about that how are you doing [patient] well i've been doing okay but i've had this wound on my right foot for a couple of weeks and it's not getting better i saw my pcp and they referred me to you i i used to see a podiatrist and a couple of years ago but they moved and i was n't able to get another one [doctor] okay and how long have you had the wound [patient] about two to three weeks [doctor] okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot [patient] no i bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy i guess i did n't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it and [doctor] okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot [patient] yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though [doctor] okay now does it hurt [patient] no i ca n't feel it [doctor] okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines [patient] no but when i take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound even when i put a band-aid on [doctor] okay well are you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem [patient] no i'm upset [doctor] i'm so upset too i love those shoes [patient] no i'm so upset i i love those shoes [doctor] okay so what kind of shoes are they [patient] they're hoka's [doctor] ah so where did you get them [patient] i got them at rei couple of years ago [doctor] they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they [patient] yeah [doctor] so what do you like about them [patient] they are comfortable they are easy to take on and off and they provide good stability [doctor] that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or [patient] yes [doctor] okay okay well another question i want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing [patient] i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight [doctor] okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here [patient] no it's okay [doctor] okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay [patient] okay [doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay [patient] okay [doctor] alright do you have any other questions [patient] no [doctor] okay,"[doctor] okay hi wayne

Fawzi al-Odah, 37, was released after a US review panel concluded he was not a ""continuing significant threat"". He had been at the US facility in Cuba since 2002 after his arrest in Pakistan on suspicion of links to al-Qaeda and the Taliban - a charge he denies. He had challenged America's right to detain him in the US Supreme Court. Mr Odah boarded a Kuwaiti government plane on Wednesday morning US time. ""There's no bitterness, there's no anger,"" his lawyer Eric Lewis was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. ""There's just excitement and joy that he will be going home."" The release came after Guantanamo's Periodic Review Board in July determined ""that continued law of war detention of (Mr Odah) does not remain necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States"". But he now faces at least a year at a militant rehabilitation centre in Kuwait, according to the terms of the release. The Kuwaiti government had pushed hard for the release of all Kuwaiti detainees at Guantanamo. Mr Odah had argued that he travelled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to teach the Koran and provide humanitarian aid. He is the first inmate to be freed since May, when five Taliban detainees were exchanged for US Sgt Bowe Bergdahl, who had been kept by the insurgents in Afghanistan. Mr Odah's release brings down the total number of inmates at the US naval base to 148. The US opened the facility in January 2002, following the 11 September 2001 attacks in America. President Barack Obama has repeatedly promised to shut it down.","The Kuwaiti government had pushed hard for the release of all Kuwaiti detainees at Guantanamo.

[patient] hey doctor michael yeah so my son sean i think you met in the past he he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out [doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do [patient] alright thank you doctor [doctor] alright thanks,"A 45-year-old male patient presents to the clinic with an ankle injury. The doctor examines the patient and determines that he has a lateral malleolar fracture, which requires surgery. The doctor prescribes medication and recommends that the patient ice and elevate the ankle, and also suggests that he continue coaching his son's basketball team while he recovers.",

my yard yesterday and i was raking leaves and i felt fine and then when i got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and i started getting pins and needles in my right foot [doctor] alright have you ever had this type of back pain before [patient] i had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day [doctor] okay and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing [patient] put some ice on it and i tried two advils and it did n't help [doctor] okay does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing [patient] yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit [doctor] okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately [patient] i i i normally do n't do any physical activity [doctor] yeah i hear you i make a i make my husband do all the yard work too so alright let me take a look at that low back if if you bend over does that hurt [patient] it hurts a little bit when i bend over yes [doctor] okay how about when you stand back up [patient] no pain [doctor] okay so no pain on extension some pain on flexion how about when i push right here on your back [patient] yeah that hurts [doctor] okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that [patient] what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts [doctor] okay and and what's your relationship [patient] partners [doctor] okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up [patient] i've spent so many times you know who i am [doctor] so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is [patient] i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts [doctor] okay so you think this is more of a long term injury [patient] no he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking but it did n't [doctor] okay alright and have you noticed any any prior pain with with the back [patient] i do n't want to take this away you better go back to talking to him [doctor] that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands [patient] can you repeat that [doctor] if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back [patient] i [doctor] alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg [patient] that would be my right leg [doctor] okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before [patient] i have not taken meloxicam [doctor] alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan [patient] it sounds reasonable [doctor] alright [patient] i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it [doctor] alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving [patient] good answer [doctor] alright

He was holding the firecracker in his left hand when it exploded. His left hand was heavily bruised and there was internal bleeding under his middle fingernail. He was suffering from tinnitus in his left ear and his hearing was partially damaged. He was afraid that his hearing may be permanently damaged and he may not be able to go for a private pilot license course at the end of the year. He didn't tell his parents the truth and he told them he smashed his fingers in the doorway. He was worried about how he was going to explain the hearing issue. He thought this was karma because he drew a huge realistic penis on his friend's physics workbook the day before.,

so i understand you're here having some left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now [patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away [doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before [patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger [doctor] mm-hmm [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so [doctor] okay [patient] of course [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then [patient] yeah [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan [patient] no that sounds good [doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay [patient] sounds great [doctor] okay thanks [patient] thanks [doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or [patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but [doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that [patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good,A patient presents with left shoulder pain and right foot pain. The doctor performs a physical exam and orders an MRI. The doctor refers the patient to physical therapy and recommends a steroid injection if the symptoms do not improve. The doctor also suggests soaking the feet in epsom salts to relieve the pain.,

wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now [doctor] okay [patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially [patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend [doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me [patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe [doctor] okay [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot [doctor] okay [patient] let me separate these [doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area [patient] no nothing like that [doctor] okay now do you have any weakness [patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no [doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels [patient] no [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they [patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright thank you [patient] bye,"[doctor] hello larry how are you doing today [patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now [doctor] okay [patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially [patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend [doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me [patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe [doctor] okay [patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah [doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain [patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot [doctor] okay [patient] let me separate these [doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area [patient] no nothing like that [doctor] okay now do you have any weakness [patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no [doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels [patient] no [doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they [patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery [doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like [patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years [doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf [patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back [doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right [patient] exactly [doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions [patient] no i ca n't recall any family members [doctor] okay alright and do you smoke [patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago [doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here [patient] okay [doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit [patient] okay that's painful [doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that [patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time [doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year [patient] okay okay [doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour [patient] okay [doctor] okay [patient] alright sounds good [doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection [patient] alright thank you [doctor] alright thank you [patient] bye

Media playback is not supported on this device A World Anti-Doping Agency commission report has accused Russia of running a ""state-sponsored"" doping programme. And Warner said he feels sports other than athletics have reason to be concerned at how Russian sport is run. ""This iceberg spreads in two different directions,"" he said. ""I suspect there are probably four, five or six nations that athletics has a problem with."" Commission chairman Dick Pound said Russia's athletics federation, Araf, should be banned from the Rio 2016 Olympics. Warner told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Every other international sport today should be looking at Russian sport and looking at whether the men and women who compete in their events are clean."" ""They do not have robust anti-doping regimes. They are asleep on the job - and they have to be rooted out."" Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, also implicated the International Association of Athletics' Federations. The IAAF's former president Lamine Diack has been provisionally suspended by the International Olympic Committee, who have also asked the IAAF to start disciplinary action against the athletes named in the report. Araf has been told to respond to the report by Friday and Russia have defended their position. Acting head of Russia Athletics Federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said: ""There is an element of a political hit job here because quite a few things were described in the report in a biased way."" Russia's sports ministry has said it will work more closely with Wada, Igor Zagorskiy, deputy director of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, Rusada, told the BBC: ""There is always room for improvement. ""We are on that track and we've been on that track together with Wada. We will continue this work on this."" Warner says the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), must be restructured to combat the problem. He revealed that he had spoken to IAAF president Lord Coe since Monday's publication of Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, and also implicated the IAAF. The 323-page report said that ""acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread"" in Russia and suggested that neither Araf, Rusada, nor the Russian Federation can be considered anti-doping code-compliant. The report also said the London 2012 Olympics were ""sabotaged"" by ""widespread inaction"" against athletes with suspicious doping profiles; accuses Moscow laboratory director Grigory Rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five Russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans. Media playback is not supported on this device Pound, who chaired the Wada investigation, said the situation was ""worse than we thought"", adding that ""it may be a residue of the old Soviet Union system"". Warner backed the recommendation to suspend Russia from competition ""until they put their house in order"", adding: ""If you punish one or two innocent Russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma I am willing to grasp."" He also suggested that Russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that ""athletics has probably got some other nations to root out"". He added that while ""there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics"", he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the Western world. During a special BBC Radio 5 live programme examining the independent report, Britain's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said: ""I don't think anyone is under the impression it's only Russia."" On the same programme, former British sprinter Darren Campbell warned of ""darker days to come"". He said: ""This report was about Russia, and they need to be punished if this holds up, but we'll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on Russia. It's about cleaning everything out. ""There's people talking about testing out in Kenya and Jamaica. We can't have rumours anymore. ""We need to understand how the Russians got away with it. How did this happen yet nobody knew? ""No matter how dark and depressing it gets, change has to happen now."" Coe, elected IAAF president in August, described the Wada report as ""alarming"" and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the Russian federation. The report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by IAAF officials and found the governing body to be ""inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood (and other) profiles"". Media playback is not supported on this device It has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations, with Coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as ""a declaration of war on my sport"" in August. On Monday, Coe said that ""if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme I will fix them"". But Warner says Coe needs to restructure the IAAF in order for it to effectively tackle the problem. ""This cannot be a one-man crusade,"" Warner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""He needs to ensure there is a bench around him at the IAAF who dramatically improve the operation. ""We all know, and he has already said, he needs to go out and hire a good chief executive. ""It needs more than that. He also possibly needs a chairman under him so he can take the lead of the elected council and be the ambassador for the sport and have full-time professional staff, possibly from outside sport, from elsewhere in business, who can get a grip on the organisation.""","The following is a summary of the report by the World Anti-Doping Agency's (Wada) independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics.

Shwe Mann was sacked from the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) last week in a power struggle. He has been rumoured to be discussing an alliance with Aung San Suu Kyi whose party is expected to win wide popular support in the 8 November elections. They will be the first elections since democratic reforms began in 2011. Rivalry between President Thein Sein and Shwe Mann came to a head last Wednesday night when trucks with security sealed off the headquarters of the party. Shwe Mann, who had been seen as a likely successor to Thein Sein, remains speaker of parliament and a USDP member. Ms Suu Kyi and Shwe Mann met for an hour on Monday in the country's capital, Naypyidaw. They have often said that they have a mutual understanding for future co-operation, reports Moe Myint of the BBC Burmese service. One likely area of collaboration might be amendment of the constitution, which prevents Ms Suu Kyi from running for the presidency. Most expect Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy to win the election, but the constitution bars her from becoming president because her children hold British passports.","The former chairman of Myanmar's ruling party has met opposition head Aung San Suu Kyi, prompting speculation of an alliance.

Nick Woodman described the remote controlled aircraft as the ""ultimate"" accessory for his firm's action cameras. He made the announcement at the Code Conference in California, where he also unveiled new kit to that helps capture video footage for virtual reality helmets. One industry watcher said GoPro's move into drones was ""very significant"". ""It's the fact that the company has such a strong brand,"" explained John Stapley from Amateur Photographer magazine. ""It's similar to what you can already see with action cameras. There are a lot of others out there but most people don't know they exist or don't have any interest in them because GoPro has become such a dominant name that it is 'the action brand' as far as they are concerned."" The risk for the firm, he added, was that other drone manufacturers would opt to partner with other camera makers to avoid supporting a competitor. The world's bestselling commercial drone maker - China's DJI - has already decided to limit initial sales of its Phantom 3 flagship to a design that features its own proprietary video camera. The previous generation had been launched instead with an optional mount for GoPro cams. Mr Woodman said he planned to release the GoPro drone within the first half of 2016, and that it would be targeted at consumers. ""Quadcopters have a special place for us at GoPro because I was a huge radio-controlled plane enthusiast as a kid and I could never really get anyone involved in it with me because it was either too geeky or it took a lot of time to learn how to fly these things - you'd crash them all the time,"" he said. ""So, I was really surprised to see how quickly the general consumer was adopting quadcopters. ""Quads plus GoPro has been one of the most democratising combinations in terms of enabling people to capture professional quality content and see themselves in their environment in a way that they'd never seen before. It looks like you're in your own movie."" Drones are expected to be one of the fastest growing electronics sectors over the coming years. According to the US's Consumer Electronics Association, the global market for consumer drones totalled $84m (Â£54m) last year but is forecast to top $300m by 2018. The CEA adds that if regulators relax the rules for the use of such aircraft by commercial organisations, the market could further swell to $1bn by 2020. That could represent a lucrative new market for GoPro. The firm's existing cameras and other accessories generated $363m of sales over the first three months of 2015. That was up 54% on the previous year, but resulted in a relatively slim net profit of $16.8m. Mr Woodman also showed off a prototype mount that can hold six of his firm's Hero4 cameras, each pointing in a different direction. He said the resulting footage could be stitched together using software developed by Kolor - a start-up it bought last month - to create a single 6K-quality 360-degree image. This could then be used with virtual reality helmets - allowing a user to change their perspective by turning their head left and right and looking up and down - or via YouTube and Facebook, which are both adding support for interactive spherical videos. The Six-Camera Spherical Array add-on will go on sale later this year. Mr Woodman acknowledged, however, that the high cost of buying enough cameras to fill it was likely to limit the mount's appeal to professionals. At a subsequent event, Google also announced a more elaborate virtual reality capture device, which involves 16 GoPro cameras, as part of a tie-up between the two companies. The footage produced by the Jump camera array will be processed by the search firm's own software to produce panoramas, rather than spherical videos, that make use of depth data deduced by Google's algorithms.","GoPro's chief executive has confirmed it will make its own quadcopter drones.

Bethany Hill, 20, was found dead with neck injuries in Stratford-upon-Avon on 3 February last year. It is alleged she was killed by Jack Williams, 21, and his girlfriend, Kayleigh Woods, 23, at the flat they all shared in Hertford Road. The pair, who are on trial at Warwick Crown Court, deny murder. See more stories from across Coventry and Warwickshire here Opening the case, prosecutor Stephen Linehan QC said Miss Hill was a former girlfriend of Williams and had a ""volatile"" relationship with Woods, a transgender woman with whom she had planned to have a child. Jurors heard Miss Hill was found dead by a police officer in a blood-drenched bathroom. Mr Linehan QC told the court: ""In the course of the killing, Beth's wrists were bound together with duct tape and the blade was used to inflict repeated cuts across the back of her neck before she was killed by the jugular vein being cut through."" He said Miss Hill was found dead after Woods, formerly known as Kyle Lockwood, dialled 999 at 19:07 GMT on 3 February, telling the operator: ""Well my best friend is dead in my flat."" Alleging the ""sadistic"" killing may have been carried out for ""perverted pleasure"", Mr Linehan QC said: ""What she was saying was that her friend had killed herself while she was out of the flat and that she had returned to find blood everywhere, and that she had cleaned up the flat before making that telephone call. ""All of these things were lies. Bethany Hill had not died as a result of cutting herself - she had been brutally, brutally murdered. ""She [Woods] lied because she was one of the two people who took part in the killing and the other person was the defendant Jack Williams. Mr Linehan said the pair had ""set about trying to cover up the truth about what they did"" from the moment of the 999 call. The court heard that Miss Hill, who was brought up in Bidford-on-Avon, had a brief relationship with Williams as a teenager. She then moved to Stratford to begin a college course, while Williams, also from the Bidford area, met Woods and moved in with her. Before the alleged killing, the court heard, Miss Hill had also moved into the flat in Hertford Road, using the bedroom, while Woods and Williams slept in the sitting room.

Bethany Hill, 20, was found dead with neck injuries in Stratford-upon-Avon on 3 February last year. It is alleged she was killed by Jack Williams, 21, and his girlfriend, Kayleigh Woods, 23, at the flat they all shared in Hertford Road. The pair, who are on trial at Warwick Crown Court, deny murder. See more stories from across Coventry and Warwickshire here Opening the case, prosecutor Stephen Linehan QC said Miss Hill was a former girlfriend of Williams and had a ""volatile"" relationship with Woods, a transgender woman with whom she had planned to have a child. Jurors heard Miss Hill was found dead by a police officer in a blood-drenched bathroom. Mr Linehan QC told the court: ""In the course of the killing, Beth's wrists were bound together with duct tape and the blade was used to inflict repeated cuts across the back of her neck before she was killed by the jugular vein being cut through."" He said Miss Hill was found dead after Woods, formerly known as Kyle Lockwood, dialled 999 at 19:07 GMT on 3 February, telling the operator: ""Well my best friend is dead in my flat."" Alleging the ""sadistic"" killing may have been carried out for ""perverted pleasure"", Mr Linehan QC said: ""What she was saying was that her friend had killed herself while she was out of the flat and that she had returned to find blood everywhere, and that she had cleaned up the flat before making that telephone call. ""All of these things were lies. Bethany Hill had not died as a result of cutting herself - she had been brutally, brutally murdered. ""She [Woods] lied because she was one of the two people who took part in the killing and the other person was the defendant Jack Williams. Mr Linehan said the pair had ""set about trying to cover up the truth about what they did"" from the moment of the 999 call. The court heard that Miss Hill, who was brought up in Bidford-on-Avon, had a brief relationship with Williams as a teenager. She then moved to Stratford to begin a college course, while Williams, also from the Bidford area, met Woods and moved in with her. Before the alleged killing, the court heard, Miss Hill had also moved into the flat in Hertford Road, using the bedroom, while Woods and Williams slept in the sitting room. The trial continues.

was getting ready for the holiday weekend and i was out on my boat skiing and i i did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since [doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then [patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend [doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it [patient] it's my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened [patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards [doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance [patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore [doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before [patient] no that was the first time [doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake [patient] lake martin [doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier [patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can [doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day [patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all [patient] no just the swelling and the pain [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day [doctor] okay and [patient] putting a cold pack on it [doctor] okay and has that helped at all [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here [patient] i had my tonsils out [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press [patient] yeah that's sore [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye [patient] thank you,Patient presents with right knee pain after water skiing.

The Slaughtneil man had the stitches inserted last Sunday and Barton expects Rogers to be out of action for a couple of more weeks. Rogers was named at midfield for the McKenna Cup final and the match video suggested he may have been caught by McCann's right elbow immediately after challenging for the initial throw-in. After the ball was thrown in, McCann came in from the side and the footage showed the Tyrone man clattering into Rogers although the Red Hand county player appeared to be focusing on the ball rather than the Derry midfielder when the contact was made.

You see the date of this Thursday karaoke night was Sept. 1, 2005, and the reason that song was stuck in my head was that Hurricane Katrina had been in the news all week. I never even associated the two things, but the audience clearly thought I was trying to make a mockery of the event. Why hadn't my friends stopped me? Maybe they were drunk. Why hadn't the karaoke DJ stopped me? Maybe he thought I deserved the ass kicking that I was clearly asking for. I weakly finished the song, dropped some cash on the table, and slunk out the door never to return.
Summary:This happened in the past. My co-workers and I decided to go out for some beers and Thursday night karaoke at a nearby bar on a hot September evening. Everyone was having a good time, drinking beers, eating pizza and getting loud. A song had been stuck in my head for days and by God I was going to get it out through the power of karaoke. I submitted my song to the DJ and waited patiently through some truly horrendous versions of the B-52s, Journey and the usual karaoke suspects. Finally my name was called, and after several bars of power chords, I began to sing a pitch perfect version of Rock You Like a Hurricane by the Scorpions. I was nailing it; I mean I was on",

over to see me how're you doing today [patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse [doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down [doctor] okay [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well [doctor] that's okay [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day [doctor] absolutely [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here [patient] no it's right here [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please [patient] okay that's it that's all i got [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan [patient] sure sounds good [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you,[doctor] hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today [patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good

49,392,392,6aafd342-68e4-4ae0-a4c0-7639bedbad0b,genaudit,XSUM,document,model,,,model,,llama3_8b,"Police in Germany have charged a man suspected of being behind an attack on the Borussia Dortmund team bus. Rather than having links to radical Islamism, he was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say. The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury. He has been  identified only as Sergej W, and was staying in the team's hotel overlooking the scene of the attack. Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus. Spanish footballer Marc Bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock. Following the attack on 11 April, Borussia Dortmund's home Champions League match against Monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led Dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters. Police initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack. However, the following week, investigators cast ""significant doubt"" on jihadist motivations being behind it. They now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed. Sergej W, 28, would have made about €3.9m euros ($4.2m; £3.2m) from his actions, Germany's Bild newspaper reported. In a statement on Friday (in German), the German federal prosecutor's office said he has German and Russian nationality. He was arrested on Friday near Tubingen in Rottenburg, south-west Germany. The suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on Borussia Dortmund shares - reportedly priced at €78,000 (£65,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack. He would have made large profits if the team's share price collapsed. Experts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because he tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly. He was staying at the team's L'Arrivée hotel in Dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say. The suspect placed the bet on 11 April using an IP address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money. Investigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed. The bus was damaged about six miles from the Westfalenstadion - officially called Signal Iduna Park - in Dortmund about 90 minutes before kick-off. Pictures from the scene showed its windows broken and its tyres burst.","Police in Germany have charged a man suspected of being behind an attack on the Borussia Dortmund team bus.

But the overall national picture for GCSE grades is very similar to last year. The proportion getting A* to C grades has nudged up from 68.8% to 69%. That represents an improvement for more than 10,000 exam entries. But the overall message - and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top A* and A grades - is that there is ""stability"". This isn't an accident. The annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate. It's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be. Well, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature. The huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands. There has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils. Add to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards. Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results. He has warned of ""volatility"", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective. ""It is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,"" said Mr Lightman. The lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit? Are there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades? Ofqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system. But it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems. Once there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year. Now there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same. Another factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam. This year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort. There are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the GCSEs early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt. And another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on GCSE maths and English last year are having to re-sit the exam this year. This means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds. But if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Northern Ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%. It raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in Wales. Not only is the Northern Ireland figure far ahead of England, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of England, which was London with 72%. England's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is Northern Ireland that is stretching further ahead. When these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in Northern Ireland are doing much better than anyone else. The scores from the GCSE top grades show the gap. Among entries from female pupils in Northern Ireland, 11.4% achieve A* grades. Among male pupils in Wales, the figure is 4.5%. In England, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest A* grades. This sets a pattern for A-levels and university entry, with Northern Irish women the most likely in the UK to get university places. Whether or not it is going to be consolation for England's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible. Because in a couple of years England's GCSEs will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than A to G, ending a common system with Wales and Northern Ireland. Another curious aside is that many of the pupils taking GCSEs this year in England did not take their Sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott. What difference did it make in the long term? It would take another exam to answer that one.","The results have been published for more than five million GCSE entries - which will be five million different stories of exam dreams, dramas and disasters.

The toilet, in a busy park in Pudong New Area, will have 10 unisex stalls, plus some urinals and a stall for disabled people. The opening on 19 November will coincide with World Toilet Day. Unisex facilities will spare officials having to decide how to share out male and female stalls, say reports. ""It is an apparent problem that women have to wait in lines for toilets,"" Fu Liping, an official involved in the project, was quoted as saying, by the Xinhua news agency. The stalls will be more spacious than regular ones. To guarantee safety and privacy, there will be attendants and higher partitions between stalls. But there are no plans yet to build more unisex toilets, as authorities are unsure whether citizens will embrace the idea. Their caution seem to be well-grounded, as people online have been less than enthusiastic about the unisex lavatory. ""I don't really support the idea.

[patient] yeah i went to see my pcp for a cough which they diagnosed as bronchitis but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure i did n't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule i went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you i'm really nervous document [doctor] okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na

first noticed it when i was loading some pay i have horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away [doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails [patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type [doctor] yeah [patient] and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot [doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride [patient] absolutely i'd love it [doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra [patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate [doctor] okay [patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now [doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking [patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago [doctor] okay [patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping [doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that [patient] no not at all [doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies [patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now [doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that [patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of [doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process [patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared [doctor] i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way [patient] okay [doctor] alright

I said, ""ready go"" and the center snapped me the ball. Now listen, I have no idea what I just called in the huddle. I just copied exactly what coach told me to say but I didn't know what ""flex right 2"" was. So, I got the snap, I looked to my right, and threw the ball to the right outside wide receiver. I was so proud of myself. ""I threw an accurate pass to the WR and coach will be proud!!"" I thought. Then the offensive line gets up and says, ""didn't he say two?"" I thought, ""yeah I said two?"" So I get back in the huddle, and I asked coach, ""did I do something wrong?"" ""Hell yeah!"" he yelled, ""you threw on a run play!"" Instantly, I thought I was going to get kicked off the team. The only thing I could do was say, ""I'm so sorry,"" about 30 times. I ended up getting yelled at, told if I do that again, I was being moved to another position, and I got laughed at and made fun of for the rest of the week and still even today by other players and friends. So I quit. I talked to my coach about it and since he knows I want to play guitar and film more, he offered a shot to go back during the fall and actually film the games! Then he said if I want to make a career out of it, he could call his good friend from South Carolina to possibly get me scholarship money to go down there and film the games.
Summary: This was about a week or two ago but I still think I should share this with you guys. I was at football practice. It was the first day of spring practice and I was practicing for QB (quarterbacks throw the ball for people who don't keep up with sports). I practiced the whole day, got dehydrated and ended up almost passing out. I asked a coach to go get water but he told me to continue to do the rest of the sprints. Anyways, it became the end of the day. It was time for me to practice with the whole offense. I got in the huddle, called ""flex right 2"" and the just said ""break?"". For people who don't know, that's not how you do a huddle, this is how you do a huddle: 1) make sure your center is looking at you; make sure your huddle is worth something 2) make sure all eyes are on you 3) say the play twice on both sides of the huddle 4) say ""ready, break"" I figured it out and I got in position.

""This film will help bridge the gap between people of the Indian mainland and those from the north-eastern states,"" Mary Kom told the BBC. The five-time world champion is from the remote northeast state of Manipur. Bhansali, who has been planning the film for a year, described the boxer as an ""inspiration to every Indian woman"". ""I am very impressed with the way Mary Kom is leading her life with so much conviction and courage. We'll start working on the film very soon. I haven't decided on who will play her role,"" Bhansali told the BBC. Recently, thousands of north-eastern people fled the Indian cities of Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad fearing reprisal attacks in the wake of ethnic clashes between Bodo tribes and Muslims in the north-eastern state of Assam. The boxer says she has been worried about her relatives and friends living in Bangalore and ""could not properly sleep at night when this exodus was taking place"". The mother of twin boys feels that Bhansali's film on her will help clear the air because ""our people look different but they are Indians. We have the same passions when the country is involved"". Bhansali's assistant Omung Kumar, who researched Mary Kom's life and wrote the script, will direct the film. But will it be possible to screen the movie in the boxer's home state Manipur, where separatist rebels have imposed a ban on Bollywood films? ""I hope nobody will object to a film if it centres on my life story, my struggles to become a boxer,"" Mary Kom said. India's thriving film industry has rarely picked on themes from the country's long-embattled north-eastern states and the few films that have been made have focused on the separatist insurgencies and India's counter-insurgency efforts in the region.","Indian Olympics bronze medallist, boxer MC Mary Kom, has welcomed a film that Bollywood director Sanjay Leela Bhansali wants to make on her life.

The five-time world champion is from the remote northeast state of Manipur. Bhansali, who has been planning the film for a year, described the boxer as an ""inspiration to every Indian woman"". ""I am very impressed with the way Mary Kom is leading her life with so much conviction and courage. We'll start working on the film very soon. I haven't decided on who will play her role,"" Bhansali told the BBC. Recently, thousands of north-eastern people fled the Indian cities of Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad fearing reprisal attacks in the wake of ethnic clashes between Bodo tribes and Muslims in the north-eastern state of Assam. The boxer says she has been worried about her relatives and friends living in Bangalore and ""could not properly sleep at night when this exodus was taking place"". The mother of twin boys feels that Bhansali's film on her will help clear the air because ""our people look different but they are Indians. We have the same passions when the country is involved"". Bhansali's assistant Omung Kumar, who researched Mary Kom's life and wrote the script, will direct the film. But will it be possible to screen the movie in the boxer's home state Manipur, where separatist rebels have imposed a ban on Bollywood films? ""I hope nobody will object to a film if it centres on my life story, my struggles to become a boxer,"" Mary Kom said.

""It gives me a lot of confidence and a lot of good friends,"" says one of the players on a five-a-side football pitch in the north of Glasgow. He's moving around nimbly on crutches, putting everything into the training and drills. There are shouts for the ball, plenty of laughter but lots of hard work. After all some of the players here have their next competitive game in just over a week. Many of them do play on crutches, others with prosthetic limbs. The sport of amputee football has been going for many years south of the border and now a charity is now trying to form a Scotland-wide league. It is holding the first amputee football Scottish Cup in Edinburgh next month. This team I am watching is linked to Partick Thistle. ""I wish, looking back, I hadn't let it stop me,"" says Brian Murray, who lost his leg to cancer at the age of 10. He says that, although as a youngster he did play on crutches with his pals, when he went to secondary school he lost confidence and began wearing his prosthetic leg all the time. His introduction to amputee football was in England, regularly travelling to Everton to get a game. It is rough at times - he broke his collarbone last year, but did not let that put him off. He describes the sport now being in Scotland as ""brilliant"". ""That's what I want to give to youngsters,"" he says. ""Don't let anyone stop you, just go for it."" He adds that if he is still playing at the age of 47, then ""it doesn't matter what age you are"". Amputee football is played all over the world. In Turkey, for instance, there is a professional league, aired on television with 600 players. Scotland is hoping to play some friendlies against other European countries later in the year. ""Amputee football is just about getting people out and playing football,"" says Ashley Reid of the Amputee Football Association Scotland (AFAS). ""The limb difference, the amputation is not relevant at all when people are here training. It's just about playing football."" She says she saw a clear demand for the sport in Scotland. The task now is to try to spread out across the country. In among the men on the pitch is one woman. In fact, she is the only woman playing in the amputee football league in the UK. ""All amputees are used to being the odd one out in the crowd,"" Rebecca Sellar explains. ""So coming into this as the only woman, you get on with it and over it."" She would like to get more women involved. Rebecca says that since she started she has been welcomed into the game and on a personal level has gained fitness as well as the enjoyment of taking part in a team sport. She says: ""Our numbers are growing and the more word we can get out there to encourage people to get involved the better we can have it as a sport for Scotland.""","Amputee football is played all over the world but it is in its infancy in Scotland, where organisers are trying to form a new league.

The task now is to try to spread out across the country. In among the men on the pitch is one woman. In fact, she is the only woman playing in the amputee football league in the UK. ""All amputees are used to being the odd one out in the crowd,"" Rebecca Sellar explains. ""So coming into this as the only woman, you get on with it and over it."" She would like to get more women involved. Rebecca says that since she started she has been welcomed into the game and on a personal level has gained fitness as well as the enjoyment of taking part in a team sport. She says: ""Our numbers are growing and the more word we can get out there to encourage people to get involved the better we can have it as a sport for Scotland.""
Summary:Amputee football is played all over the world but it is in its infancy in Scotland, where organisers are trying to form a new league. ""It gives me a lot of confidence and a lot of good friends,"" says one of the players on a five-a-side football pitch in the north of Glasgow. He's moving around nimbly on crutches, putting everything into the training and drills. There are shouts for the ball, plenty of laughter but lots of hard work. After all some of the players here have their next competitive game in just over a week. Many of them do play on crutches, others with prosthetic limbs. The sport of amputee football has been going for many years south of the border and now a charity is now trying to form a Scotland-wide league. It is holding the first amputee football Scottish Cup in Edinburgh next month. This team I am watching is linked to Partick Thistle. ""I wish, looking back, I hadn't let it stop me,"" says Brian Murray, who lost his leg to cancer at the age of 10. He says that, although as a youngster he did play on crutches with his pals, when he went to secondary school he lost confidence and began wearing his prosthetic leg all the time. His introduction to amputee football was in England, regularly travelling to Everton to get a game. It is rough at times - he broke his collarbone last year, but did not let that put him off. He describes the sport now being in Scotland as ""brilliant"". ""That's what I want to give to youngsters,"" he says. ""Don't let anyone stop you, just go for it."" He adds that if he is still playing at the age of 47, then ""it doesn't matter what age you are"". Amputee football is played all over the world. In Turkey, for instance, there is a professional league, aired on television with 600 players. Scotland is hoping to play some friendlies against other European countries later in the year.

That's hardly a surprise. These things are never made public. Removing Strachan and his coaches and finding replacements would have meant a serious hit to the coffers of an association that has routinely failed to benefit from the millions of euros on offer to those nations who qualify for major championships. Money was not brought up in the statement, but it's inconceivable that it didn't play a part in the discussion. Why pay when the World Cup campaign is already on life support? Why not accept your fate of another doomed mission, let him see out of his deal, save the cash and make a change if one needs to be made when the group fixtures are completed? The SFA couldn't say any of this. It couldn't say it was unwilling, or unable, to pay off the manager, so a different narrative was delivered in its statement, a narrative of ""jam tomorrow"". In this optimistic view of the world, all that was missing was a complimentary pair of pom-poms. All hope of a play-off spot for the World Cup is not lost, they say. They're clinging to the belief that Scotland can garner enough points from a remaining available total of 18 to force their way into the reckoning when the evidence of everybody's eyes tell us otherwise. Presenting a scenario of Scotland reeling off win after win required a fair amount of chutzpah for an association that has watched its team concede seven goals in three winless games. And that on top of two years without a competitive win against anybody other than Malta and Gibraltar. Stewart Regan, the SFA's chief executive, is quoted on how adamant Strachan is about his team's capacity to make up ground in the group. How? He doesn't say. Regan points out that the board is convinced that Strachan still has the ""hunger for the challenge"". Hunger shouldn't have anything to do with it when you've failed to qualify for the most easily accessible Euros in history and then sit fifth out of six in a World Cup qualification group with your dreams going up in a puff of smoke. Scotland will limp on now until March, when they host Slovenia at Hampden. Will we hear again that Slovenia is not a must-win? Will we see anything different? Will any new players be considered? Will there be any thoughts about a new formation? Is there likely to be any acknowledgement that, if Scotland keep doing the same things, they are going to end up with the same results? There was no hint of that in Strachan's words in the SFA statement on Thursday. No acceptance that, if he's staying on, he needs to have a major think about what he is doing, who's he selecting and not selecting. If he had spoken about a new beginning then you might - might - be inclined to buy into it. Is he even thinking about it that way? You would hope so, but it's unlikely. There is so much to ponder. Does Scotland have to follow a slavish adherence to 4-2-3-1? Can a solution be found to the absence of dominant centre-backs by converting a full-back or a midfielder? Maybe not, but where are the ideas? We saw a snapshot of Strachan's out-of-the-box thinking when he played Ikechi Anya at right-back at Wembley. What happens when Kieran Tierney and Andrew Robertson are both fit at left-back, along with Lee Wallace and Stephen Kingsley? Is it really one from four there? Does it have to be that way? Where's the innovation, the sense of a manager trying something a bit different? And what about an enhanced cast of characters on the scene? Aberdeen's Graeme Shinnie, Fulham's Tom Cairney, Brighton's Jamie Murphy, Aston Villa's Ross McCormack, Stoke City's Phil Bardsley and, yes, if he ever starts playing and scoring again, Middlesbrough's Jordan Rhodes. There are others, either on the periphery of the squad or totally divorced from it, that could be looked at properly. Too often, Strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it's done nothing for the team. The tired mantra that ""the players are just not there"" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that Scotland become truly competitive, like Northern Ireland. They have decent Premier League centre-halves - from West Brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from Southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth. And yet, from a squad largely made up of Championship, League One and Scottish Premiership players, Northern Ireland get the kind of results that are beyond Scotland. The attitude of ""no manager could do better with these players"" is fatalism. It's tantamount to a white flag being raised. A quitter's charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what Michael O'Neill is doing with his meagre resources in Belfast. The SFA's statement on Thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of Hampden. When they can't get a draw against Georgia, can't beat Lithuania and can't avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like Slovakia, the idea of Scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell. Scotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.","In the Scottish Football Association's statement of Thursday evening, there is no mention of money and the kind of cash it would have taken to bring to an end the reign of Gordon Strachan as national team manager.

decided i would finally do something about it. so i drove down to autozone and bought myself an oil change kit (5 qrts oil, oil filter, oil pan, shop towels, funnel, hand cleaner) and an air filter for about $80 total. i enlisted the help of my step father for his experience and crawled under my truck. i pointed to a square box under my truck and asked, ""is this the one?"" a hearty, ""yes!"" comes from my side and i unscrew the bolt and watch the dark liquid steadily flow into the oil pan beneath it. i let the liquid drain and crawl out from under my truck. my step father says to turn the engine on for a second to get the remaining oil out if the engine. i follow his experienced orders and turn the engine on for a second and turn it off. the box dripped the last of its drops and i plugged it up. we screw in the new oil filter and dump in the oil and i turn the key. the engine comes to life, but idles very low. my step father checks the dipstick and notes that the oil is very high on the stick and i should let the engine cool off for an accurate reading. thinking that i just finished my first successful oil change, i drive to my apartment and head in for the night. the next morning i woke up and got ready for work. i opened up the hood of my truck and checked the dipstick. the oil still showed high, several inches above the ""too much"" notch. i replaced the dipstick and closed my hood. i decided i should probably go to my parent's house and let out some more oil before i go to work, shouldn't be a few minutes for a quart or two, right? i pull out of my parking space, noticing that reverse took a few seconds to catch before lurching backwards. i put it in drive and once again i drift in neutral before the gear catches, jumping the truck forward and moving along. i turn out of the gate and onto the main road when i think some rpm's would maybe fix the problem. i push the gas and my engine revs up to 5,000 rpm  for a moment before catching first gear. i drive for about a quarter of a mile at 15 mph before it solidifies that something very serious is wrong with my beloved truck. i pull off onto a residential street, barely making a protected left turn at my speed. once parked, i call my step dad and explain the situation. he agrees it sounds strange and thinks maybe there is not enough engine oil in the engine. he drives to me with some of the materials, but after a few minutes we realize we had better let the professionals deal with it. i call up our local shop and explain the situation. his tone is ice cold, ""do not turn your engine back on. you drained all of your transmission fluid. i'm surprised you got as far as you did (6 miles total.) there could be possible internal damage in your engine from pushing double the oil through it causing dangerously high pressure. tow your truck here and we'll handle the rest."" $4,000 and a new transmission later, here i am making this post. luckily the engine wasn't damaged. **edit:** i understand i made a mistake by not doing my own research, but is it really that hard to believe i would trust my own step father to know what he was doing and follow his orders? obviously now i know not to trust him, even my mother told me not to trust him anymore after the whole incident. i don't need you people telling me i fucked up and that i shouldn't have listened to my step dad. this fuck up and lesson happened before i made this post, not during. i didn't receive your comments while i was doing the oil change. i know i fucked up, i know what i did wrong, and i know what **not** to do next time.","i made a $4,000 mistake by not doing my own research and trusting my step father to know what he was doing. i'm not asking for sympathy, i'm asking for advice on how to deal

The user's dad sent the package back because it was addressed to a sandwich. The user went to the post office and retrieved the package.

Don't insult the object of your desire with promises you both know you can't keep. If you lack the cash for that magnificent bunch of fragrant roses, resist the temptation to brandish a fraying fake bouquet instead. There has to be a better alternative, and you're unlikely to get a positive response. And as for trying to bully or force someone into partnership with you - a little tip: it's unlikely to go down well. In this respect, the EU makes a lousy suitor. After reeling in panic and reacting in slow motion to the - to an extent predicted - dramatic surge this year in refugees and other migrants arriving, the EU is now trying a more comprehensive, strategic approach. It includes an attempt to persuade (woo/push) the migrants' countries of origin, or the transit countries, to: Migration to Europe explained in graphics The EU also plans to send cash and other aid ""over there"", in the hope of dissuading more refugees and others from wanting to reach Europe, risking their lives. A rather similar formula worked for Spain several years ago when it was the main EU arrival point for people smugglers' boats. Bilateral deals with Morocco and Mauritania significantly reduced the arrival of ""pateras"", as Spaniards nicknamed those boats. But Spain came under fire from aid organisations (NGOs) at the time for trying to make African countries the ""gatekeepers of Europe"". The NGOs also raised concerns about possible human rights abuses against would-be migrants blocked at the border. They complained that the bilateral agreements, sorely lacking in transparency, smacked more of backroom deals. Similar concerns are now being directed at the EU as a whole. This week, the EU hosted a summit in Malta with African nations, in the hope of coming to an ""understanding"" on slowing the flow of migrants to Europe. But, in addition to NGO concerns (such as the risk of groups linked to human rights abuses, like the Eritrean security forces, siphoning off money allocated to stop migrants), African leaders widely dismissed EU offers of cash and other aid, as far too little to tackle the root causes of migration. As flowers go, the extra aid package doesn't even make the gaudy plastic category. The EU offered €3.6bn ($3.9bn; £2.5bn) to improve life in a number of African countries. This in addition to the €20bn it already gives in aid to Africa. Somalia's distinctly unimpressed Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke put it to the BBC that Africa needed investment, not charity, to improve its economies. The same as the US, the EU or anywhere else in the world, he said. In fact, EU countries couldn't even muster the pledged extra cash. It's a promise they seem unable or unwilling to keep. The European Commission says it will put in €1.8bn and wants the rest of the new fund made up by individual European nations. So far they've coughed up less than €80m. The EU was also unable to persuade/charm - some say bully - African countries into automatically receiving deported migrants back. Instead, in the written summit conclusions, the EU was forced to emphasise ""voluntary repatriations"". That prompted obvious questions about the bloc's declared aim of ""speeding up the return"" of economic migrants and other failed asylum seekers - a key part of its plan to tackle the migrant crisis. In short: the summit was not a resounding success. And a number of European newspapers were critical of the EU even trying to make a deal. Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung says the EU's offer of money to reduce the refugee numbers from Africa could open the EU to accusations of ""showing its real values by co-operating with unjust regimes"". Similar objections are raised when it comes to EU attempts to strike a deal with Turkey - now the main departure point for refugees and other migrants crossing to Europe. EU leaders are planning a Turkey summit before the end of the year, but - as German Chancellor Angela Merkel has pointed out - ""Ankara holds the cards"". And diplomats worry that Ankara will demand an extravagant bouquet in terms of money and political concessions - such as lifting visa restrictions, and accelerating Turkey's EU membership bid - in exchange for help on migration. And again, critics challenge the EU for courting Turkey at all - a country with an imperious president and dismal human rights record. There are also those who say the EU's focus is far too fixed on creating ""Fortress Europe"", on keeping people out and not on introducing legal ways for them to come to over. Because come they will. The European Commission expects about three million refugees and other migrants to arrive in Europe by 2017. Clearly, whatever the EU does during this crisis, it will come under fire from some quarter or another. All too often, it comes up against itself - a behemoth of 28 nations, struggling to work together. Even the quota system - accepted (reluctantly) by most EU countries - to share out more equally the asylum seekers in Europe is an unmitigated flop so far. Agreed number of people to be relocated: 160,000. People moved to date: 147. Cross-border co-operation is disintegrating as barbed wire goes up and borders slam shut across Europe: in Slovenia, Hungary, Austria, Sweden, Norway… Even Germany is toughening border regulations. In stark contrast to the warm welcome given to hundreds or thousands earlier this autumn, Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's hugely popular finance minister, has begun to mutter darkly about a migrant ""avalanche"" engulfing his country. There's little evidence of the EU - more of each country for itself. That prompted the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, to warn that Schengen, the EU agreement allowing passport-free travel across much of Europe, risks collapse. Yet it is one of the EU's proudest achievements. You could argue Schengen has already wilted and died.","The EU is trying to woo African countries to help stem the flow of migrants to Europe.

Document:my first date was with a girl named sarah. i had been debating asking her out but i decided against it because i figured it wouldn't end well. but at home coming, i finally gave in and went for it. i went up and asked her if she'd want to go see the new (at the time) divergent movie with me on friday. she was so shocked she had no idea what to say. she responded to me asking her out with ""well i guess i can't say no"". not a good sign, but at that point i don't care. my friends are all happy for me and i have a good rest of home coming. fast forward to thursday morning, in science class. the only class i have with her. she keeps bringing up how she feels like she's going to get sick. i'm thinking maybe she's just trying to get out of it. friday comes and she's not at school. i tried texting her but no response. (the next monday i learn she broke her phone) i'm pretty upset at this point. one of my friends that's known for inviting himself to this sort of thing thinks it's a good idea to invite himself and a few friends. so we get to the theatre and there i am. alone, with no idea where she is or what happened. my friend who invited himself is having a good time with the people he invited while i sat there eating my candy wanting to leave already. now days we're friends and we laugh about it. never going to forget this first date.

[doctor] hello , how are you doing today ? [patient_guest] we're okay , thank you . [doctor] that's good to hear . so , how many days has randy been feeling sick ? [patient_guest] well , i would say it started around supper time last night . [doctor] last night , okay , and what's been going on ? [patient_guest] well , he started to get a runny nose . [doctor] okay , and is he stuffy too ? [patient_guest] yeah . yeah . [doctor] okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ? [patient_guest] it is , it is right now , yes . [doctor] okay . and , does he also have a cough ? [patient_guest] yes , but it's not barky . [doctor] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ? [patient_guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah . [doctor] okay . [patient_guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too . [doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ? [patient_guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 . [doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ? [patient_guest] yes , he did . yeah . [doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ? [patient_guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle . [doctor] okay . [patient_guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either . [doctor] okay . [patient_guest] so , he varies i guess . [doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ? [patient_guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable . [doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ? [patient_guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard . [doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ? [patient_guest] yes , his older sister's been sick . [doctor] thank you . [patient_guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection . [doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ? [patient_guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose . [doctor] good , good . that's a good choice . [patient_guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating . [doctor] i see . and , any other medications ? [patient_guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier . [doctor] okay . that's good . [patient_guest] okay . okay . [doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ? [patient_guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo . [doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ? [patient_guest] no , i do n't think so . [doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps . [patient_guest] okay , sounds good . [doctor] can you take a big breath randy . [patient_guest] where's mama ? [doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too . [patient_guest] yeah , it's okay buddy . [doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears . [patient_guest] okay . [doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over . [patient_guest] dino , you're doing so good . [doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down . [patient_guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay . [doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like . [patient_guest] all right . thank you . [doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine . [doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [patient_guest] okay . [doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . [patient_guest] okay . okay . [doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough . [patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it . [doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .","[doctor] next patient is randy gutierrez . date of birth , 8/10/2020 . please use review of symptoms . all text to write . physical exam , auto text uri .

just a little nervous about what's been going on with my headaches [patient] okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here [doctor] yeah so i actually have been someone who been struggling with headaches for years now ever since i was a teenager and they used to be around my when i would have my menstrual my menses but as i got older i noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe [patient] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on [doctor] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation [patient] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse [doctor] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising [patient] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the [doctor] in my on the side of my vision [patient] okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face [doctor] no i have n't [patient] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running [doctor] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics [patient] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike [doctor] okay [patient] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike [doctor] hmmm [patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise [doctor] it is [patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri [doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri [patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about [doctor] okay [patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here [doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal [doctor] okay go ahead sorry [patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me [doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery [patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment [doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week [patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri [doctor] okay alright thank you bye [patient] bye sorry,"[doctor] alright [patient] good morning Julie how are you doing today [doctor] i'm doing okay i'm just

know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me [doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery [patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment [doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week [patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri [doctor] okay alright thank you bye [patient] bye sorry

86,670,670,b1330925-0eb6-4ed7-97d2-4b1debaa53d9,genaudit,ACIBENCH,dialogue,model,,,model,,llama3_8b,[doctor] so tyler is a 56 -year-old male who presents today complaining of difficulty swallowing and has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem [patient] well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking [doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing [patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down [doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that [patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids [doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that [patient] it's really just about solids [doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all [patient] no [doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all [patient] not that i want [doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this [patient] no [doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going [patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise [doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all [patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time [doctor] and how are the numbers looking [patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting [doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that [patient] no [doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home [patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range [doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that [patient] no that sounds great [doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that [patient] no [doctor] okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything [patient] you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great [doctor] okay sure i'll get you a refill for norvasc we'll get that sent over to the pharmacy okay [patient] thank you [doctor] alright thanks good seeing you thanks for coming in to them,[doctor] so tyler is a 56 -year-old male who presents today complaining of

[patient] yeah , there were a couple days there i took an extra one , just because there was a little extra pain in my feet . and i do have a desk job , so when i have a day off where i'm moving around a lot they do tend to hurt a bit more . [doctor] okay . how many times did you do that ? [patient] um , it was n't often , maybe once a week . [doctor] okay . so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone . we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit . and how about the methotrexate , do you think that helped with your joint pain ? [patient] yeah , definitely . because i went to get my covid shots , um , but from the letter i got about it , it said that it could interfere with the vaccine , you know , reduce the efficacy . so i did n't take it on the week that i got the first shot . [doctor] okay . and what happened ? [patient] i felt absolutely horrible until i took it again a week later . [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that . and- and what did you do about the second dose ? [patient] well , i called into the hotline because i was in so much pain with the first one . and they said , "" no , just go ahead and take it , "" so i did . [doctor] okay . that's good then . we do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high-risk medication . do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time ? [patient] no , they did n't give me one . [doctor] okay . so we can do that for you too . uhm , so what questions do you have for me , judy ? [patient] well , i just wanted to know why i was getting all these bruises here , so like when i bump myself . i do n't know where they're coming from . [doctor] okay . that's probably from the prednisone , it can increase bruising . [patient] okay . i did n't know that . um , i do n't even feel it when it happens , they just show up . [doctor] yeah . unfortunately that can happen , but we're working on discontinuing that so let's see if the bruises do go away . [patient] okay . that sounds good , thanks . [doctor] okay , judy , please , um , sit up here and i'll take a look . shoes and socks off please . [patient] all right . [doctor] all right . let me see here . okay . so where is it hurting ? in your joints right here ? [patient] yeah , a little . also in my feet joints as well . [doctor] okay . and how about when you bend the knee like this ? [patient] well , it hurt before we increased the methotrexate , but it's doing pretty good now . [doctor] okay , good . can you flex your toes please ? good range of motion . also ridges in nails , that's from the psoriasis . [patient] yeah . they've been like that for a long time now . [doctor] okay . all right , uhm , ms gomez , it looks like we're moving along with your treatment nicely . we'll stop your prednisone and continue with the methotrexate . make sure to stop by the front desk and make an appointment for the blood work , and i'll see you in three months .

[doctor] good afternoon . how are you today ? [patient] i'm good , thank you . [doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ? [patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is . [doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ? [patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well . [doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ? [patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having . [doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ? [patient] no , i definitely do n't . [doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ? [patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week . [doctor] okay . [patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs . [doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ? [patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way . [doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ? [patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac . [doctor] got it . all right . [patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it . [doctor] okay . [patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though . [doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ? [patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all . [doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ? [patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now . [doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ? [patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad . [doctor] okay . [patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy . [doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ? [patient] i do n't notice it at all . [doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ? [patient] yeah , my ankles swell . [doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ? [patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times . [doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ? [patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds . [doctor] mm-hmm . okay . [patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year . [doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ? [patient] no . [doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ? [patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication . [doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ? [patient] i'm not really sure . [doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ? [patient] yeah , you name it . [doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ? [patient] yes . [doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ? [patient] it was actually my son , not my brother . [doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment . [patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well . [doctor] okay , i see . [patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family . [doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ? [patient] correct .

[doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?

[doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .

The aim is to learn more about the behaviour of a species that experts say could cause millions of pounds of damage to crops if left untreated. Usually, if you want to study an animal, you do a survey and count it. The problem with slugs is you can't always see them as they spend much of their time out of sight in the top 10cm (4in) of the ground. But improved tracking technology will allow scientists to accurately follow slug movements for the first time. The aim of the research is to answer an interesting problem facing farmers: how do slugs live amongst their crops? The researchers at Harper Adams University have a theory slugs are not evenly distributed over a field. Instead they believe they are concentrated in patches. That's important because if the scientists could help farmers find these large patches of slugs you could target them with pest control measures. That would be cheaper and greener than spreading chemicals over an entire field. Slugs are slimy and enjoy squeezing into tight spaces so the trackers need to be placed inside the slugs themselves just under the skin. The slugs are anaesthetised before a small cut is made in the skin and the tracker inserted. The tracker itself is smaller than a grain of rice. The slugs I saw were implanted a month ago and seemed happy. It's important to the researchers that the trackers don't cause the slugs to behave any differently to their non-implanted cousins. In the lab it appears neither slug movement or appetite is affected. Tracking the slugs involves equipment that looks very like a metal detector. Researchers will go out at night when the slugs are most active and release the slugs with the trackers. There will be hundreds of them over the duration of the experiment. Then every 20 minutes throughout the night the team will scan the fields with the detector. This will automatically log the slug's individual tracker number and it's GPS location building up a very accurate map of where the slugs go and what they are doing. There's increasing pressure on farmers to reduce the chemicals they use against slugs and some are being banned outright. So if this research comes up with a better way to control them by revealing more about their behaviour it could be very useful. Funding for this study has come from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), The Potato Council and Cereals and Oilseeds who estimate that slugs could cause Â£100m of damage to UK crops if they aren't properly controlled. And finally a confession. We did take a slug out into the field and we put it down on the ground to track it. We certainly managed to find it again, the signal from its tracker was loud and strong, but we couldn't actually see it. Which means we couldn't recover the slug and he had to go and join his colleagues in the soil. It did rather show how trackers beat traditional visual slug surveys. And soon our slug implanted with a tracker will be joined by hundreds more. Update: One week on and our slug was safely recovered by the team.","At Harper Adams University they are fitting tracking devices to slugs.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said he and Mr Trump agreed to pull the vote, after it became apparent it would not get the minimum of 215 Republican votes needed. The last minute move was seen as a huge blow to Mr Trump. Repealing and replacing the programme known as Obamacare was one of his major election pledges. Earlier on Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the vote would go ahead at 15:30 (19:30 GMT). Mr Trump had reportedly warned Republicans that if they did not vote for his bill then they would be stuck with Barack Obama's healthcare programme for good. However, multiple reports suggested that between 28 and 35 Republicans were opposed to his draft American Health Care Act. The vote was withdrawn shortly after 15:30, and the House is now in recess. Republicans currently have a majority in both the House and the Senate. However, some Republicans were unhappy that the bill cut health coverage too severely, while others felt the changes did not go far enough. The bill also appeared unpopular with the public - in one recent poll, just 17% approved of it. Speaking after the withdrawal, Mr Trump blamed the Democrats for not supporting the bill and predicted that Obamacare would ""explode"". He said the Republicans would probably focus on tax reform for now. ""We have to let Obamacare go its own way for a little while,"" he said, adding that if the Democrats were ""civilised and came together"" the two parties could work out a ""great healthcare bill"". How bad was Friday's defeat of the American Health Care Act in the House of Representatives? Bad. Very bad. The American Health Care Act was the first major piece of legislation pushed by the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress, a key political test early in the president's term, when he should be at the height of his power and party cohesion at its strongest. In spite of all of this, Mr Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republicans running Washington could not get the job done. For Republicans Friday wasn't just bad. It was a disaster.

Doing big things is hard."" ""We were a 10-year opposition party where being against things was easy to do,"" he said, adding that it was difficult to get ""people to agree with each other in how we do things"". Meanwhile, Democrat and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi described it as ""a victory for the American people"". And House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said it was a ""good day"" for Americans, adding ""we worked over years to assure that the American public would have access to affordable, quality healthcare"".","The document is about the withdrawal of the healthcare bill by the US President Donald Trump.
