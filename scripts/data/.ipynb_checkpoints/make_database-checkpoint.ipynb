Citizens Advice Scotland said the number of employment cases it had seen had risen by 12% in the last four years and was  now at its highest level. It said the most common issues involved low pay, withheld wages and unfair dismissal, as well as bullying and discrimination. CAS has highlighted the issues in a report to MSPs. Holyrood\\'s Economy, Energy and Tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession. CAS said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in Scotland. Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials. Delivering the report to the Scottish Parliament, the charity\\'s spokesman Rob Gowans said:  \"What our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the Scottish CAB (Citizen Advice Bureaux) service over the last few years. \"While we don\\'t give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience. There is a growing crisis of low pay and poor conditions in Scotland. \"Around half of Scots who are in poverty are actually working. This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut. He added: \"With wages falling in real terms, families are becoming trapped in poverty, less secure terms and working hours, and with basic employment rights becoming harder to enforce.\" Mr Gowans also raised concerns about \"too many rogue employers\" who were \"exploiting\" workers under this environment. \"The growth in zero hours contracts has become a huge problem, which leaves thousands of Scots in huge financial uncertainty. And meanwhile it is becoming harder than ever to challenge unfair treatment,\" he added. SNP MSP Christina McKelvie described the CAS report as \"worrying\" and called for the Scottish Parliament to be given more powers over employment policy. She said: \"This Citizens Advice Scotland report outlines the shocking impact of austerity, social security cuts and worrying examples of employers flouting employment law.\"',\n",

It said the most common issues involved low pay, withheld wages and unfair dismissal, as well as bullying and discrimination. CAS has highlighted the issues in a report to MSPs. Holyrood\\'s Economy, Energy and Tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession. CAS said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in Scotland. Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials. Delivering the report to the Scottish Parliament, the charity\\'s spokesman Rob Gowans said:  \"What our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the Scottish CAB (Citizen Advice Bureaux) service over the last few years. \"While we don\\'t give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience. There is a growing crisis of low pay and poor conditions in Scotland. \"Around half of Scots who are in poverty are actually working. This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut. He added: \"With wages falling in real terms, families are becoming trapped in poverty, less secure terms and working hours, and with basic employment rights becoming harder to enforce.\" Mr Gowans also raised concerns about \"too many rogue employers\" who were \"exploiting\" workers under this environment. \"The growth in zero hours contracts has become a huge problem, which leaves thousands of Scots in huge financial uncertainty. And meanwhile it is becoming harder than ever to challenge unfair treatment,\" he added. SNP MSP Christina McKelvie described the CAS report as \"worrying\" and called for the Scottish Parliament to be given more powers over employment policy. She said: \"This Citizens Advice Scotland report outlines the shocking impact of austerity, social security cuts and worrying examples of employers flouting employment law.\"',\n",

Rio's offer of 16.50 Australian dollars ($16.42; Â£10.14) is now conditional on 47% of shareholders accepting it by 6 April. Previously its minimum target was 50%. The move came after talks on the A$3.9bn offer between Rio and Riversdale major shareholder, Brazil's CSN. If it fails to reach the new threshold, Rio Tinto will pay Riversdale shareholders only A$16 a share. So far only 41% have said yes. The other key shareholder in Riversdale is Tata Steel of India, which recently increased its stake to 27% and also has a director on the company's board. CSN, Brazil's largest steelmaker, has also increased its Riversdale stake to 19.9%.\",\n",

       "  \"this fuckup is currently ongoing, as i'm in a burning pain. about a week ago i felt like my earrings were pretty disgusting so i switched them out with another pair. being a dude who hasn't really worn earrings much in the past i've tried cleaning them a bunch of times but they never quite got the clean i wanted them to be. i figured i'd look into some ways to clean them and after reading something (not really sure where) i settled on peroxide. my plan was to leave them in the peroxide overnight and then clean them and see how they were in the morning... so i got a yellow plastic disposable cup and then put them in a bit of peroxide and let it go to see in the morning.... i forgot about them for quite a while and tonight, over a week later i decided it was time to take them out. being that the peroxide has been exposed to light i didn't expect much so i kind of just dumped it out and picked up the earrings... without rinsing them. now the gauge looks slightly bigger than my replacements so i decided to put one in to see if it fit still, and it did, you'd think that'd be the end of it right? wrong. i put them on the counter and go to bed, about 5 minutes later i feel a burning sensation on my nose.... my hand... my ear? seeing as how i've had a traumatic week i'm not too worried about it, i feel like i'm just paranoid, so i get up just to check at a leisurely pace and turn on the light.... to see the tip of my nose, and a bit of both my hands bleaching quickly. quickly i begin flushing my skin with water and called poison control, who simply suggested keep doing as i have been. so now part of my skin is mildly bleached, i'm throbbing in pain, and i can't fall asleep. fuck.\",\n",
       "  'The author made an error by cleaning his earrings with peroxide and inadvertently leaving them in the solution for over a week. When he removed them, he did not rinse them or the peroxide off his hands before going to bed. He suddenly felt a burning sensation on his nose and hands and realised his skin was being bleached by the residual peroxide. He contacted poison control and has begun the process of flushing his skin with water. The mistake has resulted in mild bleach burns and prevented him from getting to sleep due to the discomfort.',\n",

[doctor] okay , great . so , um , you have pain following hitting your arm on the net . on your exam , you definitely have some tenderness over your distal radius , um , on your arm . you have pain when i stress especially your thumb , and , and flex your thumb . so , i think what you have is basically just a strain and maybe a contusion to that muscle , from hitting it . um , you certainly do n't have a fracture . i think at this point , we're really going to treat it actually conservatively . we'll have you use ice , um , uh , for the , the pain and swelling . and some anti inflammatory . um , what we'll do is give you some motrin , 800 milligrams three times a day , with food . um , if it does n't get any better in the next week or so , let me know , and we'll take a look at you again . [patient] okay . [doctor] okay , great . hey dragon , go ahead and order the procedures , and the medications as discussed . why do n't you come with me . dragon you can finalize the note . [patient] thank you .\",\n",
       "  \"Mrs. Martinez visited Dr. Gomez due to pain in her arm, specifically towards her wrist, which she incurred while playing tennis. She reported slight swelling and a little pain when moving her wrist, but no numbness in her hand. Her medical history includes allergies and a past incident of injuring herself with a rake during yard work. Dr. Gomez examined an X-ray of Mrs. Martinez’s arm, which revealed no fractures or abnormalities. He further examined her arm manually, diagnosing a strain and possibly a contusion from her tennis mishap, with no indication of a fracture. The doctor recommended conservative treatment with ice for the pain and swelling, and prescribed anti-inflammatory Motrin. He advised her to inform him if there's no improvement within a week\",\n",

       "  \"Mrs. Martinez visited Dr. Gomez due to pain in her arm, specifically towards her wrist, which she incurred while playing tennis. She reported slight swelling and a little pain when moving her wrist, but no numbness in her hand. Her medical history includes allergies and a past incident of injuring herself with a rake during yard work. Dr. Gomez examined an X-ray of Mrs. Martinez’s arm, which revealed no fractures or abnormalities. He further examined her arm manually, diagnosing a strain and possibly a contusion from her tennis mishap, with no indication of a fracture. The doctor recommended conservative treatment with ice for the pain and swelling, and prescribed anti-inflammatory Motrin. He advised her to inform him if there's no improvement within a week\",\n",

Citizens Advice Scotland said the number of employment cases it had seen had risen by 12% in the last four years and was  now at its highest level.

Holyrood\\'s Economy, Energy and Tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession. CAS said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in Scotland. Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials. Delivering the report to the Scottish Parliament, the charity\\'s spokesman Rob Gowans said:  \"What our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the Scottish CAB (Citizen Advice Bureaux) service over the last few years. \"While we don\\'t give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience.

This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut. He added: \"With wages falling in real terms, families are becoming trapped in poverty, less secure terms and working hours, and with basic employment rights becoming harder to enforce.\" Mr Gowans also raised concerns about \"too many rogue employers\" who were \"exploiting\" workers under this environment. \"The growth in zero hours contracts has become a huge problem, which leaves thousands of Scots in huge financial uncertainty.

The most common issues are low pay and withheld wages, along with bullying, discrimination, and unfair dismissal. CAS submitted a report to the Scottish Parliament stating low wages are not keeping up with inflation and there are too many \"rogue employers\" exploiting workers, leading to a \"growing crisis\" in Scotland. SNP MSP Christina McKelvie called the report \"worrying\" and urged for the Scottish Parliament to gain more powers over employment policy.',\n",

Rio's offer of 16.50 Australian dollars ($16.42; Â£10.14) is now conditional on 47% of shareholders accepting it by 6 April. Previously its minimum target was 50%. The move came after talks on the A$3.9bn offer between Rio and Riversdale major shareholder, Brazil's CSN. If it fails to reach the new threshold, Rio Tinto will pay Riversdale shareholders only A$16 a share. So far only 41% have said yes. The other key shareholder in Riversdale is Tata Steel of India, which recently increased its stake to 27% and also has a director on the company's board.

i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit

Responding to suggestions some passengers may have to change trains on cross-border routes, Mrs Hart said some Whitehall officials \"don\\'t actually understand how things work and what are important\". \"I base some of their comments on ignorance rather than a conspiracy theory,\" she said. \"We want to ensure those services remain within the franchise.\" John Rogers from campaign group Railfutures Wales said: \"It\\'s ludicrous, it\\'s impractical, it\\'s being done behind the scenes with a lot of secrecy initially and we\\'re determined to fight it\". \"It\\'s not in the interests of passengers.  People hate changing trains, it\\'s a deterrent and it would affect the tourist industry,\" he added. A Department for Transport spokesman said: \"We are working closely with the Welsh government to develop plans for cross-border routes and stations as we move towards devolving the next Wales and Border franchise\".',\n",
       "  'There have been concerns that direct cross-border rail services between Wales and England could be threatened due to devolution. However, Wales\\' transport minister Edwina Hart has dismissed these claims, stating that some Whitehall officials \"don\\'t actually understand how things work and what are important\". She emphasized the importance of ensuring that services remain within the franchise. The Department of Transport also stated that no decisions would be made without considering local views. The potential changes could affect routes such as Aberystwyth to Birmingham and Milford Haven to Manchester via Cardiff. Railfutures Wales, a campaign group, has expressed opposition to the suggested changes, arguing that they would be impractical and harmful',\n",

       "  'Police in Germany have charged a man suspected of being behind an attack on the Borussia Dortmund team bus. Rather than having links to radical Islamism, he was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say. The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury. He has been  identified only as Sergej W, and was staying in the team\\'s hotel overlooking the scene of the attack. Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus. Spanish footballer Marc Bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock. Following the attack on 11 April, Borussia Dortmund\\'s home Champions League match against Monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led Dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters. Police initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack. However, the following week, investigators cast \"significant doubt\" on jihadist motivations being behind it. They now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed. Sergej W, 28, would have made about €3.9m euros ($4.2m; £3.2m) from his actions, Germany\\'s Bild newspaper reported. In a statement on Friday (in German), the German federal prosecutor\\'s office said he has German and Russian nationality. He was arrested on Friday near Tubingen in Rottenburg, south-west Germany. The suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on Borussia Dortmund shares - reportedly priced at €78,000 (£65,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack. He would have made large profits if the team\\'s share price collapsed. Experts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because he tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly. He was staying at the team\\'s L\\'Arrivée hotel in Dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say. The suspect placed the bet on 11 April using an IP address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money. Investigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed. The bus was damaged about six miles from the Westfalenstadion - officially called Signal Iduna Park - in Dortmund about 90 minutes before kick-off. Pictures from the scene showed its windows broken and its tyres burst.',\n",

i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach [doctor] great [patient] starting in april so [doctor] alright well [patient] how long [doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out [doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do [patient] alright thank you doctor [doctor] alright thanks\",\n",

had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright

had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a

The ulcer had recently become red and has been draining, a development that had not occurred before. His foot trauma may have been caused by walking barefoot on a beach, and although he had been prescribed medication, he had yet to pick them up from the pharmacy. In addition, his diabetes was not being well-controlled, evident through his high A1C of around ten. Upon inspection, the doctor confirmed redness, swelling, and drainage from the ulcer, but no bone infection, necrosis, or bony exposure were found.',\n",

       "  'When you think of a laboratory you wouldn\\'t usually think of cheering crowds or actors in costumes. You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight. But Shakespeare\\'s Globe on London\\'s Bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers. Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics The Globe\\'s site beside the River Thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor Jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse. Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself. Farah Karim-Cooper, one of the Globe\\'s resident scholars, says that it\\'s not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources. The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of \"informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence\". But this doesn\\'t mean an obsessive interest in re-creating \"authenticity\", says Dr Karim-Cooper. The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences. \"We\\'re not interested in re-enactment,\" she says. But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice. Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre? It was something that happened regularly in Shakespeare\\'s day, taking plays from the outdoor Globe to an indoor playhouse such as the Blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the River Thames. It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub. The Globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight. The Globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light. And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles. Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era. \"Darkness was a terrifying presence,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper. \"Darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick. It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.\" She says that if Elizabethans or Jacobeans travelled in time to modern London \"their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light\". Another big difference is that Shakespeare\\'s audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage. The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown. In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen. The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors. And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed Globe is that it\\'s impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play. \"It was a very social occasion,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper, describing the Shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing. \"Contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,\" she says. Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed. For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says Dr Karim-Cooper. Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue. When the audience and actors are looking into each other\\'s eyes, it becomes a different moment. There are other big changes between a modern and Shakespearean theatre visit. It would have smelled very different, says Dr Karim-Cooper. There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together. Another sensory difference would have been the \"soundscape\", she says. It would have been a much softer sound, as Elizabethan London didn\\'t have engines or loud machinery or amplified music. \"In terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,\" she says. \"There are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming. They never heard a plane taking off.\" The language would have sounded unusual too. The accent of the time would have meant words such as \"move\" and \"love\" would have sounded much closer to rhyming. And the Globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation. The role of the theatre\\'s research team isn\\'t to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors. \"There is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do. It wouldn\\'t work,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper. Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions. They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days. \"We want to get beyond Wikipedia,\" she says. She is co-editor of Moving Shakespeare Indoors, a collection of essays on indoor Jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the Globe\\'s work. There is a postgraduate degree course in Shakespeare Studies with King\\'s College, London. There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers. Every year there is a landmark schools production, the Playing Shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for London pupils. It\\'s been a huge success, with many  coming to see Shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before. Dr Karim-Cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory. \"We want to become a research hub. We want students to be here.\" The \"unique blend\" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the \"literary rigour\". \"We don\\'t separate the practical from the academic.\"',\n",
       "  \"The Globe Theatre in London has a unique approach to theatrical performances, combining academic rigor with practical experimentation. The theatre's research team, led by Farah Karim-Cooper, provides insights and advice to actors and directors, drawing from historical evidence and contemporary sources. The team also works with local schools and offers a postgraduate degree course in Shakespeare Studies.

And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed Globe is that it\\'s impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play. \"It was a very social occasion,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper, describing the Shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing. \"Contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,\" she says. Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed. For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says Dr Karim-Cooper. Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue. When the audience and actors are looking into each other\\'s eyes, it becomes a different moment. There are other big changes between a modern and Shakespearean theatre visit. It would have smelled very different, says Dr Karim-Cooper. There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together. Another sensory difference would have been the \"soundscape\", she says. It would have been a much softer sound, as Elizabethan London didn\\'t have engines or loud machinery or amplified music. \"In terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,\" she says. \"There are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming. They never heard a plane taking off.\" The language would have sounded unusual too. The accent of the time would have meant words such as \"move\" and \"love\" would have sounded much closer to rhyming. And the Globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation. The role of the theatre\\'s research team isn\\'t to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors. \"There is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do. It wouldn\\'t work,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper. Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions. They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days. \"We want to get beyond Wikipedia,\" she says. She is co-editor of Moving Shakespeare Indoors, a collection of essays on indoor Jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the Globe\\'s work. There is a postgraduate degree course in Shakespeare Studies with King\\'s College, London. There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers. Every year there is a landmark schools production, the Playing Shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for London pupils. It\\'s been a huge success, with many  coming to see Shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before. Dr Karim-Cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory. \"We want to become a research hub. We want students to be here.\" The \"unique blend\" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the \"literary rigour\". \"We don\\'t separate the practical from the academic.\"',\n",

       "  'When you think of a laboratory you wouldn\\'t usually think of cheering crowds or actors in costumes. You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight. But Shakespeare\\'s Globe on London\\'s Bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers. Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics The Globe\\'s site beside the River Thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor Jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse. Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself. Farah Karim-Cooper, one of the Globe\\'s resident scholars, says that it\\'s not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources. The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of \"informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence\". But this doesn\\'t mean an obsessive interest in re-creating \"authenticity\", says Dr Karim-Cooper. The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences. \"We\\'re not interested in re-enactment,\" she says. But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice. Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre? It was something that happened regularly in Shakespeare\\'s day, taking plays from the outdoor Globe to an indoor playhouse such as the Blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the River Thames. It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub. The Globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight. The Globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light. And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles. Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era. \"Darkness was a terrifying presence,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper. \"Darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick. It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.\" She says that if Elizabethans or Jacobeans travelled in time to modern London \"their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light\". Another big difference is that Shakespeare\\'s audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage. The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.

His release followed a decision by Guantanamo\\'s Periodic Review Board in July that his continued detention was not necessary. He is now facing a year at a militant rehabilitation centre in Kuwait as per release terms. Al-Odah’s release reduces the total number of inmates at the US naval base to 148.',\n",

when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that

a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue

       "  \"A patient, Gregory, visited a doctor for a nonhealing foot ulcer that had been present for two months. The patient had been to the beach and possibly stepped on something, causing the ulcer. The patient's vital signs were normal, but there was redness, drainage, and swelling around the ulcer. The doctor suspected an infection and ordered an ABI (ankle brachial index) test to determine blood supply to the foot. The doctor also performed a debridement and prescribed clindamycin to treat the infection. The patient was instructed to wear a surgical shoe and return for another appointment in two weeks.\",\n",

had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office
