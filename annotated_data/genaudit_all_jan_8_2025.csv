Fawzi al-odah, 37, was released after a us review panel concluded he was not a ""continuing significant threat"".
He had been at the us facility in cuba since 2002 after his arrest in pakistan on suspicion of links to al-qaeda and the taliban - a charge he denies.
He had challenged america's right to detain him in the us supreme court.
Mr odah boarded a kuwaiti government plane on wednesday morning us time.
""there's no bitterness, there's no anger,"" his lawyer eric lewis was quoted as saying by the associated press news agency.
""there's just excitement and joy that he will be going home.""
The release came after guantanamo's periodic review board in july determined ""that continued law of war detention of (mr odah) does not remain necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the united states"".
But he now faces at least a year at a militant rehabilitation centre in kuwait, according to the terms of the release.
The kuwaiti government had pushed hard for the release of all kuwaiti detainees at guantanamo.
Mr odah had argued that he travelled to afghanistan and pakistan to teach the koran and provide humanitarian aid.
He is the first inmate to be freed since may, when five taliban detainees were exchanged for us sgt bowe bergdahl, who had been kept by the insurgents in afghanistan.
Mr odah's release brings down the total number of inmates at the us naval base to 148.
The us opened the facility in january 2002, following the 11 september 2001 attacks in america.
President barack obama has repeatedly promised to shut it down.","Fawzi al-Odah, a Kuwaiti man who was held at Guantanamo Bay for over 12 years, has been released and returned to Kuwait.

You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.
But shakespeare's globe on london's bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.
Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics the globe's site beside the river thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.
Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the sam wanamaker playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.
Farah karim-cooper, one of the globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.
The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"".
But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says dr karim-cooper.
The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.
""we're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says.
But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice.
Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?
It was something that happened regularly in shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor globe to an indoor playhouse such as the blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the river thames.
It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub.
The globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.
The globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.
And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.
Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.
""darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says dr karim-cooper.
""darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.
It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.""
She says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"".
Another big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.
The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.
In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.
The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.
And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.
""it was a very social occasion,"" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.
""contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says.
Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.
For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.
Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.
When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.
There are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.
It would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.
There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.
Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says.
It would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.
""in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says.
""there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.

You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.
But shakespeare's globe on london's bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.
Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics the globe's site beside the river thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.
Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the sam wanamaker playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.
Farah karim-cooper, one of the globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.
The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"".
But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says dr karim-cooper.
The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.
""we're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says.
But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice.
Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?
It was something that happened regularly in shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor globe to an indoor playhouse such as the blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the river thames.
It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub.
The globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.
The globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.
And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.
Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.
""darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says dr karim-cooper.
""darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.
It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.""
She says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"".
Another big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.
The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.
In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.
The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.
And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.
""it was a very social occasion,"" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.
""contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says.
Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.
For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.
Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.
When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.
There are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.
It would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.
There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.
Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says.
It would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.
""in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says.
""there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.

Rather than having links to radical islamism, he was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say.
The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury.
He has been  identified only as sergej w, and was staying in the team's hotel overlooking the scene of the attack.
Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus.
Spanish footballer marc bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock.
Following the attack on 11 april, borussia dortmund's home champions league match against monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters.
Police initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack.
However, the following week, investigators cast ""significant doubt"" on jihadist motivations being behind it.
They now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed.
Sergej w, 28, would have made about €3.9m euros ($4.2m; £3.2m) from his actions, germany's bild newspaper reported.
In a statement on friday (in german), the german federal prosecutor's office said he has german and russian nationality.
He was arrested on friday near tubingen in rottenburg, south-west germany.
The suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on borussia dortmund shares - reportedly priced at €78,000 (£65,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack.
He would have made large profits if the team's share price collapsed.

You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.
But shakespeare's globe on london's bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.
Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics the globe's site beside the river thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.
Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the sam wanamaker playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.
Farah karim-cooper, one of the globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.
The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"".
But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says dr karim-cooper.
The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.
""we're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says.
But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice.
Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?
It was something that happened regularly in shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor globe to an indoor playhouse such as the blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the river thames.
It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub.
The globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.
The globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.
And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.
Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.
""darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says dr karim-cooper.
""darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.
It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.""
She says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"".
Another big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.
The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.
In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.
The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.
And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.
""it was a very social occasion,"" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.
""contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says.
Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.
For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.
Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.
When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.
There are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.
It would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.
There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.
Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says.
It would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.
""in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says.
""there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.
They never heard a plane taking off.""
The language would have sounded unusual too.
The accent of the time would have meant words such as ""move"" and ""love"" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.
And the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.
The role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.
""there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.
It wouldn't work,"" says dr karim-cooper.
Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.
They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.
""we want to get beyond wikipedia,"" she says.
She is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe's work.
There is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king's college, london.
There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.
Every year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.
It's been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.
Dr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.

Citizens advice scotland said the number of employment cases it had seen had risen by 12% in the last four years and was  now at its highest level.
It said the most common issues involved low pay, withheld wages and unfair dismissal, as well as bullying and discrimination.
Cas has highlighted the issues in a report to msps.
Holyrood's economy, energy and tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession.
Cas said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in scotland.
Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials.
Delivering the report to the scottish parliament, the charity's spokesman rob gowans said:  ""what our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the scottish cab (citizen advice bureaux) service over the last few years.
""while we don't give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience.
There is a growing crisis of low pay and poor conditions in scotland.
""around half of scots who are in poverty are actually working.
This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut.
He added: ""with wages falling in real terms, families are becoming trapped in poverty, less secure terms and working hours, and with basic employment rights becoming harder to enforce.""
Mr gowans also raised concerns about ""too many rogue employers"" who were ""exploiting"" workers under this environment.
""the growth in zero hours contracts has become a huge problem, which leaves thousands of scots in huge financial uncertainty.
And meanwhile it is becoming harder than ever to challenge unfair treatment,"" he added.
Snp msp christina mckelvie described the cas report as ""worrying"" and called for the scottish parliament to be given more powers over employment policy.
She said: ""this citizens advice scotland report outlines the shocking impact of austerity, social security cuts and worrying examples of employers flouting employment law.""","A report by Citizens Advice Scotland has found that the country's workforce is facing a crisis of low pay and poor conditions, with a 12% increase in employment cases over the past four years.

So i'm in my first year of college and was getting into the typical college stuff; partying, sports, alcohol, and of course academics.
About 3 weeks ago i was working on a math assignment online, which provides instant feedback on whether you got the question correct.
Typically its pretty easy and i'm done within about 30 minutes, but this one was incredibly difficult.
Already about 90 minutes in and not even halfway done, i had spent about the last 10 on one problem.
Confident in the answer i got, i submitted and saw that i was wrong.
Frustrated, i quickly (and according to my roommates, not even that hard) hit my laptop and went to see where i could have gone in the process.
I then wanted to change tabs, but for some reason my computer was not responding, which to me wasn't a big deal since it had happened a few times earlier, so i did what i normally did and did a hard power off.
Turning on the power again, my heart immediately dropped.
Black screen.
Computer beeping.
Message with something similar to 'error in bootup.'
I immediately check my phone on the error and see that it likely has something to do with hard drive, and it was confirmed on one of the info in the settings said that no hard drive was found.
Luckily my roommates were super nice and let me use one of their laptops to complete the assignment.
The next day i took it to the campus tech services for help.
And it took them about half a week for them to tell me that they wouldn't be able to help with the issue i originally told them about.
(looking back it was probably dumb to take it to them, since they aren't the biggest tech experts, but i'm a student and i'm not made of money.)
The next week was pretty bad, i spent it in the library or on the roommates laptops doing homework and searching on my phone for places to go to get it repaired.
And with my schedule conflicting with their open times (the only places that were open on weekends were way too expensive for my budget) and the fact that i didn't take a car to college and had to bum rides from one of my roommates, i was out of luck for that entire week.
Finally, late last week i finally got time to go to a repair place and finally get it done.
Upon immediate review the hard drive was busted and basically unsalvagable and i had to get a new one.
Luckily the people were kind and gave me a fair estimate of about $200 (which was like 1/2 other places were estimating) and also tacked on a student discount.
Still shipping for a new hard drive and repairs took a week, so that was another week in the library and borrowing laptops again.
Finally today i got news of it being repaired.
Spent most of the day reinstalling things and finally can get back to my usual daily life of web browsing reddit and steam games.
Math homework has also been a lot easier so the same thing repeating should hopefully be avoided for a long time now.","i needed to finish a math assignment and the computer didn't have the answer, so i turned off the computer hard drive. when it booted up it wouldn't even let me log in, let alone do anything useful. had to look for help at the campus tech services, as the error message was too specific to be able to fix. after a few weeks, they discovered that the hard drive was completely broken and they were unable to salvage it, so they had to install a new one. finally done with all the work, so things are back to normal.",falcon7b,genaudit,REDDIT,i,highlight-inference,,not_likely,common,high_consequence,1

Frustrated, i quickly (and according to my roommates, not even that hard) hit my laptop and went to see where i could have gone in the process.
I then wanted to change tabs, but for some reason my computer was not responding, which to me wasn't a big deal since it had happened a few times earlier, so i did what i normally did and did a hard power off.
Turning on the power again, my heart immediately dropped.

Message with something similar to 'error in bootup.'
I immediately check my phone on the error and see that it likely has something to do with hard drive, and it was confirmed on one of the info in the settings said that no hard drive was found.
Luckily my roommates were super nice and let me use one of their laptops to complete the assignment.
The next day i took it to the campus tech services for help.
And it took them about half a week for them to tell me that they wouldn't be able to help with the issue i originally told them about.
(looking back it was probably dumb to take it to them, since they aren't the biggest tech experts, but i'm a student and i'm not made of money.)
The next week was pretty bad, i spent it in the library or on the roommates laptops doing homework and searching on my phone for places to go to get it repaired.
And with my schedule conflicting with their open times (the only places that were open on weekends were way too expensive for my budget) and the fact that i didn't take a car to college and had to bum rides from one of my roommates, i was out of luck for that entire week.
Finally, late last week i finally got time to go to a repair place and finally get it done.
Upon immediate review the hard drive was busted and basically unsalvagable and i had to get a new one.
Luckily the people were kind and gave me a fair estimate of about $200 (which was like 1/2 other places were estimating) and also tacked on a student discount.
Still shipping for a new hard drive and repairs took a week, so that was another week in the library and borrowing laptops again.

Confident in the answer i got, i submitted and saw that i was wrong.
Frustrated, i quickly (and according to my roommates, not even that hard) hit my laptop and went to see where i could have gone in the process.
I then wanted to change tabs, but for some reason my computer was not responding, which to me wasn't a big deal since it had happened a few times earlier, so i did what i normally did and did a hard power off.
Turning on the power again, my heart immediately dropped.

Computer beeping.

I immediately check my phone on the error and see that it likely has something to do with hard drive, and it was confirmed on one of the info in the settings said that no hard drive was found.
Luckily my roommates were super nice and let me use one of their laptops to complete the assignment.
The next day i took it to the campus tech services for help.
And it took them about half a week for them to tell me that they wouldn't be able to help with the issue i originally told them about.
(looking back it was probably dumb to take it to them, since they aren't the biggest tech experts, but i'm a student and i'm not made of money.)
The next week was pretty bad, i spent it in the library or on the roommates laptops doing homework and searching on my phone for places to go to get it repaired.
And with my schedule conflicting with their open times (the only places that were open on weekends were way too expensive for my budget) and the fact that i didn't take a car to college and had to bum rides from one of my roommates, i was out of luck for that entire week.
Finally, late last week i finally got time to go to a repair place and finally get it done.
Upon immediate review the hard drive was busted and basically unsalvagable and i had to get a new one.
Luckily the people were kind and gave me a fair estimate of about $200 (which was like 1/2 other places were estimating) and also tacked on a student discount.
Still shipping for a new hard drive and repairs took a week, so that was another week in the library and borrowing laptops again.
Finally today i got news of it being repaired.

After she comes out i give her a kiss goodbye and walk outside.

[doctor] how are you doing ?
[patient] i'm doing well .
There's been so many events now that we've been able to get vaccinated , i've been able to see my grandkids again , go to more birthday parties , it's been fantastic .
[doctor] yeah , i know .
I've ... i mean , we've had some communication over telehealth and that type of thing , but it's not the same as being in-person , so i'm happy to see you today .
Now tell me a little bit about , you know , we have n't really got a chance to talk about your depression .
How are you ... how are you doing with that ?
I know we have n't had you on medication in the past because you're on medication for other things .
What are your strategies with dealing with it ?
[patient] so i've been going to therapy once a week for the past year .
Um , mostly virtually , um , but starting to get in-person .
Virtual was a bit of a struggle , but i feel like being in-person with someone really helps me .
[doctor] okay .
And do y- do you have a good support system at home ?
[patient] yes , i do .
I have my husband and , uh , my kids are right down the street from me , so i'm very lucky .
[doctor] okay .
All right .
So that's good to hear .
[doctor] how about your blood pressure ?
Did you buy the blood pressure cuff that i- [patient] yes .
[doctor] .
Told you to ?
Okay .
I know that we've been in communication and your blood pressures have been running okay .
The last time i spoke with you , how are they doing since we last spoke ?
[patient] they've been doing well .
I've been using the cuff , um , once a day , and they seem pretty normal .
[doctor] okay .
And are you taking the lisinopril that i prescribed ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
Great .
All right .
So i know that you did a review of systems sheet with the nurse when you checked in .
You know , i know that you were talking about some nasal congestion .
Do you have any other symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no ?
Okay .
All right .
Well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the vital signs .
So here in the office , you know , your blood pressure looks really good , as does your heart rate .
So you are doing a good job managing your blood pressure .
So i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay .
So on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck .
On your heart exam i do notice a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable .
Your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ?
But i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .
Hey , dragon , show me the ekg .
And the nurses did an ekg before you came in , and that looks perfectly fine , okay ?
So i wan na just go ahead and talk a little about your assessment and my plan for you .
So for your first problem , your depression , i think you're doing a really good job with your strategies .
I do n't think ... it does n't sound to me like i need to start you on any medication at this time , unless you feel differently .
[patient] no , i'm , i'm , good in that department .
[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .
I wan na just continue on the lisinopril , 20 milligrams a day .
And i want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well , and if they start rising , i want you to contact me , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and for your third problem , for an annual exam maintenance , you know , you're due for a mammogram , so we'll go ahead and schedule that , okay ?
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right .
Do you have any questions ?
[patient] um , can i take all my medicine at the same time ?
Does it matter ?
[doctor] yeah .
You can set an alarm so that it reminds you to take your medication .

just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular

[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .

[patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your

always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all

foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright great,"A patient, Gregory, visited a doctor for a nonhealing foot ulcer that had been present for two months.

So i'm in my first year of college and was getting into the typical college stuff; partying, sports, alcohol, and of course academics.
About 3 weeks ago i was working on a math assignment online, which provides instant feedback on whether you got the question correct.
Typically its pretty easy and i'm done within about 30 minutes, but this one was incredibly difficult.
Already about 90 minutes in and not even halfway done, i had spent about the last 10 on one problem.
Confident in the answer i got, i submitted and saw that i was wrong.
Frustrated, i quickly (and according to my roommates, not even that hard) hit my laptop and went to see where i could have gone in the process.
I then wanted to change tabs, but for some reason my computer was not responding, which to me wasn't a big deal since it had happened a few times earlier, so i did what i normally did and did a hard power off.
Turning on the power again, my heart immediately dropped.
Black screen.
Computer beeping.
Message with something similar to 'error in bootup.'
I immediately check my phone on the error and see that it likely has something to do with hard drive, and it was confirmed on one of the info in the settings said that no hard drive was found.
Luckily my roommates were super nice and let me use one of their laptops to complete the assignment.
The next day i took it to the campus tech services for help.
And it took them about half a week for them to tell me that they wouldn't be able to help with the issue i originally told them about.
(looking back it was probably dumb to take it to them, since they aren't the biggest tech experts, but i'm a student and i'm not made of money.)
The next week was pretty bad, i spent it in the library or on the roommates laptops doing homework and searching on my phone for places to go to get it repaired.
And with my schedule conflicting with their open times (the only places that were open on weekends were way too expensive for my budget) and the fact that i didn't take a car to college and had to bum rides from one of my roommates, i was out of luck for that entire week.
Finally, late last week i finally got time to go to a repair place and finally get it done.
Upon immediate review the hard drive was busted and basically unsalvagable and i had to get a new one.
Luckily the people were kind and gave me a fair estimate of about $200 (which was like 1/2 other places were estimating) and also tacked on a student discount.
Still shipping for a new hard drive and repairs took a week, so that was another week in the library and borrowing laptops again.
Finally today i got news of it being repaired.
Spent most of the day reinstalling things and finally can get back to my usual daily life of web browsing reddit and steam games.
Math homework has also been a lot easier so the same thing repeating should hopefully be avoided for a long time now.","i needed to finish a math assignment and the computer didn't have the answer, so i turned off the computer hard drive. when it booted up it wouldn't even let me log in, let alone do anything useful. had to look for help at the campus tech services, as the error message was too specific to be able to fix. after a few weeks, they discovered that the hard drive was completely broken and they were unable to salvage it, so they had to install a new one. finally done with all the work, so things are back to normal.",falcon7b,genaudit,REDDIT,didn't have the answer,highlight-mistake,,not_likely,common,high_consequence,1

So i'm in my first year of college and was getting into the typical college stuff; partying, sports, alcohol, and of course academics.
About 3 weeks ago i was working on a math assignment online, which provides instant feedback on whether you got the question correct.
Typically its pretty easy and i'm done within about 30 minutes, but this one was incredibly difficult.
Already about 90 minutes in and not even halfway done, i had spent about the last 10 on one problem.
Confident in the answer i got, i submitted and saw that i was wrong.
Frustrated, i quickly (and according to my roommates, not even that hard) hit my laptop and went to see where i could have gone in the process.
I then wanted to change tabs, but for some reason my computer was not responding, which to me wasn't a big deal since it had happened a few times earlier, so i did what i normally did and did a hard power off.
Turning on the power again, my heart immediately dropped.
Black screen.
Computer beeping.
Message with something similar to 'error in bootup.'
I immediately check my phone on the error and see that it likely has something to do with hard drive, and it was confirmed on one of the info in the settings said that no hard drive was found.
Luckily my roommates were super nice and let me use one of their laptops to complete the assignment.
The next day i took it to the campus tech services for help.
And it took them about half a week for them to tell me that they wouldn't be able to help with the issue i originally told them about.
(looking back it was probably dumb to take it to them, since they aren't the biggest tech experts, but i'm a student and i'm not made of money.)
The next week was pretty bad, i spent it in the library or on the roommates laptops doing homework and searching on my phone for places to go to get it repaired.
And with my schedule conflicting with their open times (the only places that were open on weekends were way too expensive for my budget) and the fact that i didn't take a car to college and had to bum rides from one of my roommates, i was out of luck for that entire week.
Finally, late last week i finally got time to go to a repair place and finally get it done.
Upon immediate review the hard drive was busted and basically unsalvagable and i had to get a new one.
Luckily the people were kind and gave me a fair estimate of about $200 (which was like 1/2 other places were estimating) and also tacked on a student discount.
Still shipping for a new hard drive and repairs took a week, so that was another week in the library and borrowing laptops again.

[patient] i'm doing well .
There's been so many events now that we've been able to get vaccinated , i've been able to see my grandkids again , go to more birthday parties , it's been fantastic .
[doctor] yeah , i know .
I've ... i mean , we've had some communication over telehealth and that type of thing , but it's not the same as being in-person , so i'm happy to see you today .
Now tell me a little bit about , you know , we have n't really got a chance to talk about your depression .
How are you ... how are you doing with that ?
I know we have n't had you on medication in the past because you're on medication for other things .
What are your strategies with dealing with it ?
[patient] so i've been going to therapy once a week for the past year .
Um , mostly virtually , um , but starting to get in-person .
Virtual was a bit of a struggle , but i feel like being in-person with someone really helps me .
[doctor] okay .
And do y- do you have a good support system at home ?
[patient] yes , i do .
I have my husband and , uh , my kids are right down the street from me , so i'm very lucky .
[doctor] okay .
All right .
So that's good to hear .
[doctor] how about your blood pressure ?
Did you buy the blood pressure cuff that i- [patient] yes .
[doctor] .
Told you to ?
Okay .
I know that we've been in communication and your blood pressures have been running okay .
The last time i spoke with you , how are they doing since we last spoke ?
[patient] they've been doing well .
I've been using the cuff , um , once a day , and they seem pretty normal .
[doctor] okay .
And are you taking the lisinopril that i prescribed ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
Great .
All right .
So i know that you did a review of systems sheet with the nurse when you checked in .
You know , i know that you were talking about some nasal congestion .
Do you have any other symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no ?
Okay .
All right .
Well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the vital signs .
So here in the office , you know , your blood pressure looks really good , as does your heart rate .
So you are doing a good job managing your blood pressure .
So i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay .
So on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck .
On your heart exam i do notice a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable .
Your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ?
But i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .
Hey , dragon , show me the ekg .
And the nurses did an ekg before you came in , and that looks perfectly fine , okay ?
So i wan na just go ahead and talk a little about your assessment and my plan for you .
So for your first problem , your depression , i think you're doing a really good job with your strategies .
I do n't think ... it does n't sound to me like i need to start you on any medication at this time , unless you feel differently .
[patient] no , i'm , i'm , good in that department .
[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .
I wan na just continue on the lisinopril , 20 milligrams a day .
And i want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well , and if they start rising , i want you to contact me , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and for your third problem , for an annual exam maintenance , you know , you're due for a mammogram , so we'll go ahead and schedule that , okay ?
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right .
Do you have any questions ?
[patient] um , can i take all my medicine at the same time ?
Does it matter ?
[doctor] yeah .
You can set an alarm so that it reminds you to take your medication .
But yeah , you can , you can take them altogether .

I've ... i mean , we've had some communication over telehealth and that type of thing , but it's not the same as being in-person , so i'm happy to see you today .
Now tell me a little bit about , you know , we have n't really got a chance to talk about your depression .
How are you ... how are you doing with that ?
I know we have n't had you on medication in the past because you're on medication for other things .
What are your strategies with dealing with it ?
[patient] so i've been going to therapy once a week for the past year .
Um , mostly virtually , um , but starting to get in-person .
Virtual was a bit of a struggle , but i feel like being in-person with someone really helps me .
[doctor] okay .
And do y- do you have a good support system at home ?
[patient] yes , i do .
I have my husband and , uh , my kids are right down the street from me , so i'm very lucky .
[doctor] okay .
All right .
So that's good to hear .
[doctor] how about your blood pressure ?
Did you buy the blood pressure cuff that i- [patient] yes .
[doctor] .
Told you to ?
Okay .
I know that we've been in communication and your blood pressures have been running okay .
The last time i spoke with you , how are they doing since we last spoke ?
[patient] they've been doing well .
I've been using the cuff , um , once a day , and they seem pretty normal .
[doctor] okay .
And are you taking the lisinopril that i prescribed ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
Great .
All right .
So i know that you did a review of systems sheet with the nurse when you checked in .
You know , i know that you were talking about some nasal congestion .
Do you have any other symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no ?
Okay .
All right .
Well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the vital signs .
So here in the office , you know , your blood pressure looks really good , as does your heart rate .
So you are doing a good job managing your blood pressure .
So i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay .
So on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck .
On your heart exam i do notice a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable .
Your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ?
But i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .
Hey , dragon , show me the ekg .
And the nurses did an ekg before you came in , and that looks perfectly fine , okay ?
So i wan na just go ahead and talk a little about your assessment and my plan for you .
So for your first problem , your depression , i think you're doing a really good job with your strategies .
I do n't think ... it does n't sound to me like i need to start you on any medication at this time , unless you feel differently .
[patient] no , i'm , i'm , good in that department .
[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .
I wan na just continue on the lisinopril , 20 milligrams a day .
And i want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well , and if they start rising , i want you to contact me , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and for your third problem , for an annual exam maintenance , you know , you're due for a mammogram , so we'll go ahead and schedule that , okay ?
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right .
Do you have any questions ?
[patient] um , can i take all my medicine at the same time ?
Does it matter ?
[doctor] yeah .
You can set an alarm so that it reminds you to take your medication .
But yeah , you can , you can take them altogether .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .
Hey , dragon , finalize the note .","The document outlines a conversation between a doctor and a patient named Elizabeth, a 66-year-old woman with a medical history of depression and hypertension.

foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright great,"A patient, Gregory, visited a doctor for a nonhealing foot ulcer that had been present for two months.

Citizens advice scotland said the number of employment cases it had seen had risen by 12% in the last four years and was  now at its highest level.
It said the most common issues involved low pay, withheld wages and unfair dismissal, as well as bullying and discrimination.
Cas has highlighted the issues in a report to msps.
Holyrood's economy, energy and tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession.
Cas said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in scotland.
Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials.
Delivering the report to the scottish parliament, the charity's spokesman rob gowans said:  ""what our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the scottish cab (citizen advice bureaux) service over the last few years.
""while we don't give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience.
There is a growing crisis of low pay and poor conditions in scotland.
""around half of scots who are in poverty are actually working.
This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut.
He added: ""with wages falling in real terms, families are becoming trapped in poverty, less secure terms and working hours, and with basic employment rights becoming harder to enforce.""
Mr gowans also raised concerns about ""too many rogue employers"" who were ""exploiting"" workers under this environment.
""the growth in zero hours contracts has become a huge problem, which leaves thousands of scots in huge financial uncertainty.
And meanwhile it is becoming harder than ever to challenge unfair treatment,"" he added.

just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam [patient] okay,"A patient with asthma symptoms is frustrated with their condition and frequent flare-ups, which

foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness

The patient had been to the beach and possibly stepped on something, causing the ulcer. The patient's vital signs were normal, but there was redness, drainage, and swelling around the ulcer. The doctor suspected an infection and ordered an ABI (ankle brachial index) test to determine blood supply to the foot. The doctor also performed a debridement and prescribed clindamycin to treat the infection. The patient was instructed to wear a surgical shoe and return for another appointment in two weeks.",llama70b,genaudit,ACIBENCH,test,highlight-inference,,obvious,no,low_consequence,1

just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your

[doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay

323,f28f994a-deb3-4e7e-80be-2010d32b028e,YtYC5w,ACIBENCH-D2N119:llama70b-ul2,[doctor] hey betty how are you doing [patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing

Now tell me a little bit about , you know , we have n't really got a chance to talk about your depression .
How are you ... how are you doing with that ?
I know we have n't had you on medication in the past because you're on medication for other things .

So i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay .
So on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck .
On your heart exam i do notice a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable .
Your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ?
But i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .
Hey , dragon , show me the ekg .
And the nurses did an ekg before you came in , and that looks perfectly fine , okay ?
So i wan na just go ahead and talk a little about your assessment and my plan for you .
So for your first problem , your depression , i think you're doing a really good job with your strategies .
I do n't think ... it does n't sound to me like i need to start you on any medication at this time , unless you feel differently .
[patient] no , i'm , i'm , good in that department .
[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .
I wan na just continue on the lisinopril , 20 milligrams a day .
And i want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well , and if they start rising , i want you to contact me , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and for your third problem , for an annual exam maintenance , you know , you're due for a mammogram , so we'll go ahead and schedule that , okay ?
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right .
Do you have any questions ?
[patient] um , can i take all my medicine at the same time ?
Does it matter ?
[doctor] yeah .
You can set an alarm so that it reminds you to take your medication .
But yeah , you can , you can take them altogether .

[patient] no , i'm , i'm , good in that department .
[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .

And i want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well , and if they start rising , i want you to contact me , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and for your third problem , for an annual exam maintenance , you know , you're due for a mammogram , so we'll go ahead and schedule that , okay ?
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right .
Do you have any questions ?
[patient] um , can i take all my medicine at the same time ?
Does it matter ?
[doctor] yeah .
You can set an alarm so that it reminds you to take your medication .
But yeah , you can , you can take them altogether .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .

Kind of toward my wrist .
This part of my arm .

And did it swell up at all ?

It got a ... it had a little bit of swelling .
Not a lot .

Do you have any past medical history of anything ?
[patient] um , yes .

[patient] on my rake .

Great .
So , let's take a look at , uh , the x-ray of your arm .
Hey dragon , let's see the x-ray .
Okay , looking at your x-ray , i do n't see any fractures , uh , do n't really see any abnormalities at all .
It looks essentially normal .
Great .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] does it hurt when i press on your arm here ?
[patient] yes .

[patient] not as much .
[doctor] and how about when i flex like this ?
[patient] a little .
[doctor] but mostly when i do that type of motion ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , great .
So , um , you have pain following hitting your arm on the net .
On your exam , you definitely have some tenderness over your distal radius , um , on your arm .
You have pain when i stress especially your thumb , and , and flex your thumb .
So , i think what you have is basically just a strain and maybe a contusion to that muscle , from hitting it .
Um , you certainly do n't have a fracture .
I think at this point , we're really going to treat it actually conservatively .
We'll have you use ice , um , uh , for the , the pain and swelling .
And some anti inflammatory .
Um , what we'll do is give you some motrin , 800 milligrams three times a day , with food .
Um , if it does n't get any better in the next week or so , let me know , and we'll take a look at you again .

just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam [patient] okay,"A patient with asthma symptoms is frustrated with their condition and frequent flare-ups, which

Edwina hart accused uk officials of ""ignorance"" amid suggestions passengers could have to change trains on some services between wales and england.
Responsibility for the wales and border network will be devolved in 2017.
A department of transport spokesman said no decisions would be made without considering local views.
Services from aberystwyth to birmingham and milford haven to manchester via cardiff, are among routes which could be affected.
In last year's st david's day agreement, the uk government wrote: ""in order for the secretary of state for transport to ensure proper accountability, it is likely that services primarily serving english markets will be placed into other franchises for which the secretary of state for transport is the franchising authority"".
Responding to suggestions some passengers may have to change trains on cross-border routes, mrs hart said some whitehall officials ""don't actually understand how things work and what are important"".
""i base some of their comments on ignorance rather than a conspiracy theory,"" she said.
""we want to ensure those services remain within the franchise.""
John rogers from campaign group railfutures wales said: ""it's ludicrous, it's impractical, it's being done behind the scenes with a lot of secrecy initially and we're determined to fight it"".
""it's not in the interests of passengers.
People hate changing trains, it's a deterrent and it would affect the tourist industry,"" he added.
A department for transport spokesman said: ""we are working closely with the welsh government to develop plans for cross-border routes and stations as we move towards devolving the next wales and border franchise"".","There have been concerns that direct cross-border rail services between Wales and England could be threatened due to devolution. However, Wales' transport minister Edwina Harthas dismissed these claims, stating that some Whitehall officials ""don't actually understand how things work and what are important"". She emphasized the importance of ensuring that services remain within the franchise. The Department of Transport also stated that no decisions would be made without considering local views. The potential changes could affect routes such as Aberystwyth to Birmingham and Milford Haven to Manchester via Cardiff.

was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright great,"A patient, Gregory, visited a doctor for a nonhealing foot ulcer that had been present for two months.

The doctor suspected an infection and ordered an ABI (ankle brachial index) test to determine blood supply to the foot. The doctor also performed a debridement and prescribed clindamycin to treat the infection.

Edwina hart accused uk officials of ""ignorance"" amid suggestions passengers could have to change trains on some services between wales and england.
Responsibility for the wales and border network will be devolved in 2017.
A department of transport spokesman said no decisions would be made without considering local views.
Services from aberystwyth to birmingham and milford haven to manchester via cardiff, are among routes which could be affected.
In last year's st david's day agreement, the uk government wrote: ""in order for the secretary of state for transport to ensure proper accountability, it is likely that services primarily serving english markets will be placed into other franchises for which the secretary of state for transport is the franchising authority"".
Responding to suggestions some passengers may have to change trains on cross-border routes, mrs hart said some whitehall officials ""don't actually understand how things work and what are important"".
""i base some of their comments on ignorance rather than a conspiracy theory,"" she said.
""we want to ensure those services remain within the franchise.""
John rogers from campaign group railfutures wales said: ""it's ludicrous, it's impractical, it's being done behind the scenes with a lot of secrecy initially and we're determined to fight it"".
""it's not in the interests of passengers.
People hate changing trains, it's a deterrent and it would affect the tourist industry,"" he added.
A department for transport spokesman said: ""we are working closely with the welsh government to develop plans for cross-border routes and stations as we move towards devolving the next wales and border franchise"".","There have been concerns that direct cross-border rail services between Wales and England could be threatened due to devolution. However, Wales' transport minister Edwina Hart has dismissed these claims, stating that some Whitehall officials ""don't actually understand how things work and what are important"".

So i'm in my first year of college and was getting into the typical college stuff; partying, sports, alcohol, and of course academics.
About 3 weeks ago i was working on a math assignment online, which provides instant feedback on whether you got the question correct.
Typically its pretty easy and i'm done within about 30 minutes, but this one was incredibly difficult.
Already about 90 minutes in and not even halfway done, i had spent about the last 10 on one problem.
Confident in the answer i got, i submitted and saw that i was wrong.
Frustrated, i quickly (and according to my roommates, not even that hard) hit my laptop and went to see where i could have gone in the process.
I then wanted to change tabs, but for some reason my computer was not responding, which to me wasn't a big deal since it had happened a few times earlier, so i did what i normally did and did a hard power off.
Turning on the power again, my heart immediately dropped.
Black screen.
Computer beeping.
Message with something similar to 'error in bootup.'
I immediately check my phone on the error and see that it likely has something to do with hard drive, and it was confirmed on one of the info in the settings said that no hard drive was found.
Luckily my roommates were super nice and let me use one of their laptops to complete the assignment.
The next day i took it to the campus tech services for help.
And it took them about half a week for them to tell me that they wouldn't be able to help with the issue i originally told them about.
(looking back it was probably dumb to take it to them, since they aren't the biggest tech experts, but i'm a student and i'm not made of money.)
The next week was pretty bad, i spent it in the library or on the roommates laptops doing homework and searching on my phone for places to go to get it repaired.
And with my schedule conflicting with their open times (the only places that were open on weekends were way too expensive for my budget) and the fact that i didn't take a car to college and had to bum rides from one of my roommates, i was out of luck for that entire week.
Finally, late last week i finally got time to go to a repair place and finally get it done.
Upon immediate review the hard drive was busted and basically unsalvagable and i had to get a new one.
Luckily the people were kind and gave me a fair estimate of about $200 (which was like 1/2 other places were estimating) and also tacked on a student discount.
Still shipping for a new hard drive and repairs took a week, so that was another week in the library and borrowing laptops again.
Finally today i got news of it being repaired.
Spent most of the day reinstalling things and finally can get back to my usual daily life of web browsing reddit and steam games.
Math homework has also been a lot easier so the same thing repeating should hopefully be avoided for a long time now.","A college student's laptop hard drive fails, causing problems with completing homework assignments and accessing important files.

[doctor] yeah , i know .
I've ... i mean , we've had some communication over telehealth and that type of thing , but it's not the same as being in-person , so i'm happy to see you today .
Now tell me a little bit about , you know , we have n't really got a chance to talk about your depression .
How are you ... how are you doing with that ?
I know we have n't had you on medication in the past because you're on medication for other things .
What are your strategies with dealing with it ?
[patient] so i've been going to therapy once a week for the past year .
Um , mostly virtually , um , but starting to get in-person .
Virtual was a bit of a struggle , but i feel like being in-person with someone really helps me .
[doctor] okay .
And do y- do you have a good support system at home ?
[patient] yes , i do .
I have my husband and , uh , my kids are right down the street from me , so i'm very lucky .
[doctor] okay .
All right .
So that's good to hear .
[doctor] how about your blood pressure ?
Did you buy the blood pressure cuff that i- [patient] yes .
[doctor] .
Told you to ?
Okay .
I know that we've been in communication and your blood pressures have been running okay .
The last time i spoke with you , how are they doing since we last spoke ?
[patient] they've been doing well .
I've been using the cuff , um , once a day , and they seem pretty normal .
[doctor] okay .
And are you taking the lisinopril that i prescribed ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
Great .
All right .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay .
So on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck .
On your heart exam i do notice a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable .
Your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ?
But i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .
Hey , dragon , show me the ekg .

So for your first problem , your depression , i think you're doing a really good job with your strategies .
I do n't think ... it does n't sound to me like i need to start you on any medication at this time , unless you feel differently .
[patient] no , i'm , i'm , good in that department .
[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .
I wan na just continue on the lisinopril , 20 milligrams a day .
And i want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well , and if they start rising , i want you to contact me , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and for your third problem , for an annual exam maintenance , you know , you're due for a mammogram , so we'll go ahead and schedule that , okay ?

[doctor] all right .
Do you have any questions ?
[patient] um , can i take all my medicine at the same time ?

It got a ... it had a little bit of swelling .
Not a lot .

And , um , did , uh , do you have any numbness in your hand at all ?
Or any pain when you move your wrist ?

Um , no numbness in my hand .
[doctor] okay .
Do you have any past medical history of anything ?
[patient] um , yes .
Allergic , um , l- i have allergies .
And so i take flonase .
[doctor] okay .
And any surgeries in the past ?
[patient] yes .
I actually had a trauma of , um , a stabbing of , um ... i actually fell doing lawn work- [doctor] okay .
[patient] on my rake .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i was wondering where you were going to go with that .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
Great .
So , let's take a look at , uh , the x-ray of your arm .
Hey dragon , let's see the x-ray .
Okay , looking at your x-ray , i do n't see any fractures , uh , do n't really see any abnormalities at all .
It looks essentially normal .
Great .
Let me examine you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does it hurt when i press on your arm here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
How about when i bend your arm ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
That's pretty tender , ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] how about when i go backwards like that ?
[patient] not as much .
[doctor] and how about when i flex like this ?
[patient] a little .
[doctor] but mostly when i do that type of motion ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , great .
So , um , you have pain following hitting your arm on the net .
On your exam , you definitely have some tenderness over your distal radius , um , on your arm .
You have pain when i stress especially your thumb , and , and flex your thumb .
So , i think what you have is basically just a strain and maybe a contusion to that muscle , from hitting it .
Um , you certainly do n't have a fracture .
I think at this point , we're really going to treat it actually conservatively .
We'll have you use ice , um , uh , for the , the pain and swelling .
And some anti inflammatory .
Um , what we'll do is give you some motrin , 800 milligrams three times a day , with food .
Um , if it does n't get any better in the next week or so , let me know , and we'll take a look at you again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , great .
Hey dragon , go ahead and order the procedures , and the medications as discussed .
Why do n't you come with me .
Dragon you can finalize the note .
[patient] thank you .","A 43-year-old female patient, Mrs. Martinez, visited Dr. Gomez with complaints of pain in her distal radius following a tennis accident.

Good to see you today .
[patient] hey , dr .
Gomez .
[doctor] hey , dragon , i'm here seeing mrs .
Martinez .
She's a 43-year-old female .
Why are we seeing you today ?
[patient] um , my arm hurts right here .
Kind of toward my wrist .
This part of my arm .
[doctor] so you have pain in your distal radius ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] how did that happen ?
[patient] um , i was playing tennis , and when i went to hit , um , i was given a , a backhand , and when i did , i m- totally missed the ball , hit the top of the net but the pole part .
And , and it just jarred my arm .
[doctor] okay .
And did it swell up at all ?
Or- [patient] it did .
It got a ... it had a little bit of swelling .
Not a lot .
[doctor] okay .
And , um , did , uh , do you have any numbness in your hand at all ?
Or any pain when you move your wrist ?
[patient] a little bit when i move my wrist .
Um , no numbness in my hand .
[doctor] okay .
Do you have any past medical history of anything ?
[patient] um , yes .
Allergic , um , l- i have allergies .
And so i take flonase .
[doctor] okay .
And any surgeries in the past ?
[patient] yes .
I actually had a trauma of , um , a stabbing of , um ... i actually fell doing lawn work- [doctor] okay .
[patient] on my rake .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i was wondering where you were going to go with that .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
Great .
So , let's take a look at , uh , the x-ray of your arm .
Hey dragon , let's see the x-ray .
Okay , looking at your x-ray , i do n't see any fractures , uh , do n't really see any abnormalities at all .
It looks essentially normal .
Great .
Let me examine you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does it hurt when i press on your arm here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
How about when i bend your arm ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
That's pretty tender , ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] how about when i go backwards like that ?
[patient] not as much .
[doctor] and how about when i flex like this ?
[patient] a little .
[doctor] but mostly when i do that type of motion ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , great .
So , um , you have pain following hitting your arm on the net .
On your exam , you definitely have some tenderness over your distal radius , um , on your arm .
You have pain when i stress especially your thumb , and , and flex your thumb .
So , i think what you have is basically just a strain and maybe a contusion to that muscle , from hitting it .
Um , you certainly do n't have a fracture .
I think at this point , we're really going to treat it actually conservatively .
We'll have you use ice , um , uh , for the , the pain and swelling .
And some anti inflammatory .
Um , what we'll do is give you some motrin , 800 milligrams three times a day , with food .
Um , if it does n't get any better in the next week or so , let me know , and we'll take a look at you again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , great .
Hey dragon , go ahead and order the procedures , and the medications as discussed .
Why do n't you come with me .
Dragon you can finalize the note .

About a week ago i felt like my earrings were pretty disgusting so i switched them out with another pair.
Being a dude who hasn't really worn earrings much in the past i've tried cleaning them a bunch of times but they never quite got the clean i wanted them to be.
I figured i'd look into some ways to clean them and after reading something (not really sure where) i settled on peroxide.
My plan was to leave them in the peroxide overnight and then clean them and see how they were in the morning... so i got a yellow plastic disposable cup and then put them in a bit of peroxide and let it go to see in the morning.... i forgot about them for quite a while and tonight, over a week later i decided it was time to take them out.
Being that the peroxide has been exposed to light i didn't expect much so i kind of just dumped it out and picked up the earrings... without rinsing them.

So i'm in my first year of college and was getting into the typical college stuff; partying, sports, alcohol, and of course academics.
About 3 weeks ago i was working on a math assignment online, which provides instant feedback on whether you got the question correct.
Typically its pretty easy and i'm done within about 30 minutes, but this one was incredibly difficult.
Already about 90 minutes in and not even halfway done, i had spent about the last 10 on one problem.
Confident in the answer i got, i submitted and saw that i was wrong.
Frustrated, i quickly (and according to my roommates, not even that hard) hit my laptop and went to see where i could have gone in the process.
I then wanted to change tabs, but for some reason my computer was not responding, which to me wasn't a big deal since it had happened a few times earlier, so i did what i normally did and did a hard power off.
Turning on the power again, my heart immediately dropped.
Black screen.
Computer beeping.
Message with something similar to 'error in bootup.'
I immediately check my phone on the error and see that it likely has something to do with hard drive, and it was confirmed on one of the info in the settings said that no hard drive was found.
Luckily my roommates were super nice and let me use one of their laptops to complete the assignment.
The next day i took it to the campus tech services for help.
And it took them about half a week for them to tell me that they wouldn't be able to help with the issue i originally told them about.
(looking back it was probably dumb to take it to them, since they aren't the biggest tech experts, but i'm a student and i'm not made of money.)
The next week was pretty bad, i spent it in the library or on the roommates laptops doing homework and searching on my phone for places to go to get it repaired.
And with my schedule conflicting with their open times (the only places that were open on weekends were way too expensive for my budget) and the fact that i didn't take a car to college and had to bum rides from one of my roommates, i was out of luck for that entire week.
Finally, late last week i finally got time to go to a repair place and finally get it done.
Upon immediate review the hard drive was busted and basically unsalvagable and i had to get a new one.
Luckily the people were kind and gave me a fair estimate of about $200 (which was like 1/2 other places were estimating) and also tacked on a student discount.
Still shipping for a new hard drive and repairs took a week, so that was another week in the library and borrowing laptops again.
Finally today i got news of it being repaired.
Spent most of the day reinstalling things and finally can get back to my usual daily life of web browsing reddit and steam games.
Math homework has also been a lot easier so the same thing repeating should hopefully be avoided for a long time now.","A college student's laptop hard drive fails, causing problems with completing homework assignments and accessing important files.

Quickly i begin flushing my skin with water and called poison control, who simply suggested keep doing as i have been.
So now part of my skin is mildly bleached, i'm throbbing in pain, and i can't fall asleep.
Fuck.","The author made an error by cleaning his earrings with peroxide and inadvertently leaving them in the solution for over a week. When he removed them, he did not rinse them or the peroxide off his hands before going to bed. He suddenly felt a burning sensation on his nose and hands and realised his skin was being bleached by the residual peroxide. He contacted poison control and has begun the process of flushing his skin with water.

Edwina hart accused uk officials of ""ignorance"" amid suggestions passengers could have to change trains on some services between wales and england.
Responsibility for the wales and border network will be devolved in 2017.
A department of transport spokesman said no decisions would be made without considering local views.
Services from aberystwyth to birmingham and milford haven to manchester via cardiff, are among routes which could be affected.
In last year's st david's day agreement, the uk government wrote: ""in order for the secretary of state for transport to ensure proper accountability, it is likely that services primarily serving english markets will be placed into other franchises for which the secretary of state for transport is the franchising authority"".
Responding to suggestions some passengers may have to change trains on cross-border routes, mrs hart said some whitehall officials ""don't actually understand how things work and what are important"".
""i base some of their comments on ignorance rather than a conspiracy theory,"" she said.
""we want to ensure those services remain within the franchise.""
John rogers from campaign group railfutures wales said: ""it's ludicrous, it's impractical, it's being done behind the scenes with a lot of secrecy initially and we're determined to fight it"".
""it's not in the interests of passengers.
People hate changing trains, it's a deterrent and it would affect the tourist industry,"" he added.
A department for transport spokesman said: ""we are working closely with the welsh government to develop plans for cross-border routes and stations as we move towards devolving the next wales and border franchise"".","Wales' transport minister, Edwina Hart, has dismissed claims that direct cross-border rail services between Wales and England could be under threat due to devolution.

[doctor] okay , great .
So , um , you have pain following hitting your arm on the net .
On your exam , you definitely have some tenderness over your distal radius , um , on your arm .
You have pain when i stress especially your thumb , and , and flex your thumb .
So , i think what you have is basically just a strain and maybe a contusion to that muscle , from hitting it .
Um , you certainly do n't have a fracture .
I think at this point , we're really going to treat it actually conservatively .
We'll have you use ice , um , uh , for the , the pain and swelling .
And some anti inflammatory .
Um , what we'll do is give you some motrin , 800 milligrams three times a day , with food .
Um , if it does n't get any better in the next week or so , let me know , and we'll take a look at you again .

So , um , you have pain following hitting your arm on the net .
On your exam , you definitely have some tenderness over your distal radius , um , on your arm .
You have pain when i stress especially your thumb , and , and flex your thumb .
So , i think what you have is basically just a strain and maybe a contusion to that muscle , from hitting it .
Um , you certainly do n't have a fracture .
I think at this point , we're really going to treat it actually conservatively .
We'll have you use ice , um , uh , for the , the pain and swelling .
And some anti inflammatory .
Um , what we'll do is give you some motrin , 800 milligrams three times a day , with food .
Um , if it does n't get any better in the next week or so , let me know , and we'll take a look at you again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , great .
Hey dragon , go ahead and order the procedures , and the medications as discussed .
Why do n't you come with me .
Dragon you can finalize the note .

Edwina hart accused uk officials of ""ignorance"" amid suggestions passengers could have to change trains on some services between wales and england.
Responsibility for the wales and border network will be devolved in 2017.
A department of transport spokesman said no decisions would be made without considering local views.
Services from aberystwyth to birmingham and milford haven to manchester via cardiff, are among routes which could be affected.
In last year's st david's day agreement, the uk government wrote: ""in order for the secretary of state for transport to ensure proper accountability, it is likely that services primarily serving english markets will be placed into other franchises for which the secretary of state for transport is the franchising authority"".
Responding to suggestions some passengers may have to change trains on cross-border routes, mrs hart said some whitehall officials ""don't actually understand how things work and what are important"".
""i base some of their comments on ignorance rather than a conspiracy theory,"" she said.
""we want to ensure those services remain within the franchise.""
John rogers from campaign group railfutures wales said: ""it's ludicrous, it's impractical, it's being done behind the scenes with a lot of secrecy initially and we're determined to fight it"".
""it's not in the interests of passengers.
People hate changing trains, it's a deterrent and it would affect the tourist industry,"" he added.
A department for transport spokesman said: ""we are working closely with the welsh government to develop plans for cross-border routes and stations as we move towards devolving the next wales and border franchise"".","There have been concerns that direct cross-border rail services between Wales and England could be threatened due to devolution. However, Wales' transport minister Edwina Harthas dismissed these claims, stating that some Whitehall officials ""don't actually understand how things work and what are important"". She emphasized the importance of ensuring that services remain within the franchise. The Department of Transport also stated that no decisions would be made without considering local views.

You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.
But shakespeare's globe on london's bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.
Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics the globe's site beside the river thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.
Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the sam wanamaker playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.
Farah karim-cooper, one of the globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.
The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"".
But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says dr karim-cooper.
The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.
""we're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says.
But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice.
Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?
It was something that happened regularly in shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor globe to an indoor playhouse such as the blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the river thames.
It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub.
The globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.
The globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.
And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.
Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.
""darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says dr karim-cooper.
""darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.
It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.""
She says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"".
Another big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.
The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.
In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.
The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.
And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.
""it was a very social occasion,"" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.
""contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says.
Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.
For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.
Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.
When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.
There are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.
It would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.
There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.
Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says.
It would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.
""in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says.
""there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.
They never heard a plane taking off.""
The language would have sounded unusual too.
The accent of the time would have meant words such as ""move"" and ""love"" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.
And the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.
The role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.
""there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.
It wouldn't work,"" says dr karim-cooper.
Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.
They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.
""we want to get beyond wikipedia,"" she says.
She is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe's work.
There is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king's college, london.
There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.
Every year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.
It's been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.
Dr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.
""we want to become a research hub.
We want students to be here.""
The ""unique blend"" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the ""literary rigour"".

So i'm in my first year of college and was getting into the typical college stuff; partying, sports, alcohol, and of course academics.
About 3 weeks ago i was working on a math assignment online, which provides instant feedback on whether you got the question correct.
Typically its pretty easy and i'm done within about 30 minutes, but this one was incredibly difficult.
Already about 90 minutes in and not even halfway done, i had spent about the last 10 on one problem.
Confident in the answer i got, i submitted and saw that i was wrong.
Frustrated, i quickly (and according to my roommates, not even that hard) hit my laptop and went to see where i could have gone in the process.
I then wanted to change tabs, but for some reason my computer was not responding, which to me wasn't a big deal since it had happened a few times earlier, so i did what i normally did and did a hard power off.
Turning on the power again, my heart immediately dropped.
Black screen.
Computer beeping.
Message with something similar to 'error in bootup.'
I immediately check my phone on the error and see that it likely has something to do with hard drive, and it was confirmed on one of the info in the settings said that no hard drive was found.
Luckily my roommates were super nice and let me use one of their laptops to complete the assignment.
The next day i took it to the campus tech services for help.
And it took them about half a week for them to tell me that they wouldn't be able to help with the issue i originally told them about.
(looking back it was probably dumb to take it to them, since they aren't the biggest tech experts, but i'm a student and i'm not made of money.)
The next week was pretty bad, i spent it in the library or on the roommates laptops doing homework and searching on my phone for places to go to get it repaired.
And with my schedule conflicting with their open times (the only places that were open on weekends were way too expensive for my budget) and the fact that i didn't take a car to college and had to bum rides from one of my roommates, i was out of luck for that entire week.
Finally, late last week i finally got time to go to a repair place and finally get it done.
Upon immediate review the hard drive was busted and basically unsalvagable and i had to get a new one.
Luckily the people were kind and gave me a fair estimate of about $200 (which was like 1/2 other places were estimating) and also tacked on a student discount.
Still shipping for a new hard drive and repairs took a week, so that was another week in the library and borrowing laptops again.
Finally today i got news of it being repaired.
Spent most of the day reinstalling things and finally can get back to my usual daily life of web browsing reddit and steam games.
Math homework has also been a lot easier so the same thing repeating should hopefully be avoided for a long time now.","i needed to finish a math assignment and the computer didn't have the answer, so i turned off the computer hard drive. when it booted up it wouldn't even let me log in, let alone do anything useful. had to look for help at the campus tech services, as the error message was too specific to be able to fix. after a few weeks, they discovered that the hard drive was completely broken and they were unable to salvage it, so they had to install a new one. finally done with all the work, so things are back to normal.",falcon7b,genaudit,REDDIT,wouldn't even let me log in,highlight-inference,,obvious,somewhat_common,low_consequence,1

About a week ago i felt like my earrings were pretty disgusting so i switched them out with another pair.
Being a dude who hasn't really worn earrings much in the past i've tried cleaning them a bunch of times but they never quite got the clean i wanted them to be.
I figured i'd look into some ways to clean them and after reading something (not really sure where) i settled on peroxide.
My plan was to leave them in the peroxide overnight and then clean them and see how they were in the morning... so i got a yellow plastic disposable cup and then put them in a bit of peroxide and let it go to see in the morning.... i forgot about them for quite a while and tonight, over a week later i decided it was time to take them out.
Being that the peroxide has been exposed to light i didn't expect much so i kind of just dumped it out and picked up the earrings... without rinsing them.
Now the gauge looks slightly bigger than my replacements so i decided to put one in to see if it fit still, and it did, you'd think that'd be the end of it right?
Wrong.
I put them on the counter and go to bed, about 5 minutes later i feel a burning sensation on my nose.... my hand... my ear?
Seeing as how i've had a traumatic week i'm not too worried about it, i feel like i'm just paranoid, so i get up just to check at a leisurely pace and turn on the light.... to see the tip of my nose, and a bit of both my hands bleaching quickly.
Quickly i begin flushing my skin with water and called poison control, who simply suggested keep doing as i have been.
So now part of my skin is mildly bleached, i'm throbbing in pain, and i can't fall asleep.
Fuck.","The author made an error by cleaning his earrings with peroxide and inadvertently leaving them in the solution for over a week. When he removed them, he did not rinse them or the peroxide off his hands before going to bed.

Being a dude who hasn't really worn earrings much in the past i've tried cleaning them a bunch of times but they never quite got the clean i wanted them to be.
I figured i'd look into some ways to clean them and after reading something (not really sure where) i settled on peroxide.
My plan was to leave them in the peroxide overnight and then clean them and see how they were in the morning... so i got a yellow plastic disposable cup and then put them in a bit of peroxide and let it go to see in the morning.... i forgot about them for quite a while and tonight, over a week later i decided it was time to take them out.
Being that the peroxide has been exposed to light i didn't expect much so i kind of just dumped it out and picked up the earrings... without rinsing them.
Now the gauge looks slightly bigger than my replacements so i decided to put one in to see if it fit still, and it did, you'd think that'd be the end of it right?
Wrong.
I put them on the counter and go to bed, about 5 minutes later i feel a burning sensation on my nose.... my hand... my ear?
Seeing as how i've had a traumatic week i'm not too worried about it, i feel like i'm just paranoid, so i get up just to check at a leisurely pace and turn on the light.... to see the tip of my nose, and a bit of both my hands bleaching quickly.
Quickly i begin flushing my skin with water and called poison control, who simply suggested keep doing as i have been.
So now part of my skin is mildly bleached, i'm throbbing in pain, and i can't fall asleep.

You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.
But shakespeare's globe on london's bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.
Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics the globe's site beside the river thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.
Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the sam wanamaker playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.
Farah karim-cooper, one of the globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.
The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"".
But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says dr karim-cooper.
The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.
""we're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says.
But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice.
Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?
It was something that happened regularly in shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor globe to an indoor playhouse such as the blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the river thames.
It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub.
The globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.
The globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.
And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.
Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.
""darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says dr karim-cooper.
""darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.
It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.""
She says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"".
Another big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.
The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.
In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.
The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.
And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.
""it was a very social occasion,"" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.
""contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says.
Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.
For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.
Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.
When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.
There are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.
It would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.
There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.
Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says.
It would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.
""in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says.
""there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.
They never heard a plane taking off.""
The language would have sounded unusual too.
The accent of the time would have meant words such as ""move"" and ""love"" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.
And the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.
The role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.
""there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.
It wouldn't work,"" says dr karim-cooper.
Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.
They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.
""we want to get beyond wikipedia,"" she says.
She is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe's work.
There is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king's college, london.
There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.
Every year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.
It's been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.
Dr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.

You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.
But shakespeare's globe on london's bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.
Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics the globe's site beside the river thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.
Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the sam wanamaker playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.
Farah karim-cooper, one of the globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.
The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"".
But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says dr karim-cooper.
The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.
""we're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says.
But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice.
Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?
It was something that happened regularly in shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor globe to an indoor playhouse such as the blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the river thames.
It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub.
The globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.
The globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.
And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.
Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.
""darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says dr karim-cooper.
""darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.
It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.""
She says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"".
Another big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.
The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.
In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.
The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.
And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.
""it was a very social occasion,"" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.
""contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says.
Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.
For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.
Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.
When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.
There are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.
It would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.
There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.
Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says.
It would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.
""in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says.
""there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.
They never heard a plane taking off.""
The language would have sounded unusual too.
The accent of the time would have meant words such as ""move"" and ""love"" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.
And the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.
The role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.
""there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.
It wouldn't work,"" says dr karim-cooper.
Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.
They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.
""we want to get beyond wikipedia,"" she says.
She is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe's work.
There is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king's college, london.
There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.
Every year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.
It's been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.
Dr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.
""we want to become a research hub.
We want students to be here.""
The ""unique blend"" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the ""literary rigour"".

They now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed.
Sergej w, 28, would have made about €3.9m euros ($4.2m; £3.2m) from his actions, germany's bild newspaper reported.
In a statement on friday (in german), the german federal prosecutor's office said he has german and russian nationality.
He was arrested on friday near tubingen in rottenburg, south-west germany.
The suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on borussia dortmund shares - reportedly priced at €78,000 (£65,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack.
He would have made large profits if the team's share price collapsed.
Experts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because he tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly.
He was staying at the team's l'arrivée hotel in dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say.
The suspect placed the bet on 11 april using an ip address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money.
Investigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed.
The bus was damaged about six miles from the westfalenstadion - officially called signal iduna park - in dortmund about 90 minutes before kick-off.
Pictures from the scene showed its windows broken and its tyres burst.","A Russian man has been arrested for plotting a terrorist attack in Germany, which targeted Borussia Dortmund players and staff.

Rather than having links to radical islamism, he was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say.
The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury.
He has been  identified only as sergej w, and was staying in the team's hotel overlooking the scene of the attack.
Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus.
Spanish footballer marc bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock.
Following the attack on 11 april, borussia dortmund's home champions league match against monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters.

About 3 weeks ago i was working on a math assignment online, which provides instant feedback on whether you got the question correct.
Typically its pretty easy and i'm done within about 30 minutes, but this one was incredibly difficult.
Already about 90 minutes in and not even halfway done, i had spent about the last 10 on one problem.

Frustrated, i quickly (and according to my roommates, not even that hard) hit my laptop and went to see where i could have gone in the process.
I then wanted to change tabs, but for some reason my computer was not responding, which to me wasn't a big deal since it had happened a few times earlier, so i did what i normally did and did a hard power off.
Turning on the power again, my heart immediately dropped.

And with my schedule conflicting with their open times (the only places that were open on weekends were way too expensive for my budget) and the fact that i didn't take a car to college and had to bum rides from one of my roommates, i was out of luck for that entire week.
Finally, late last week i finally got time to go to a repair place and finally get it done.

na have to keep this my favorite story is that i had a sandra who injured her knee cold dancing so that would immediately came up to mine but let's try skiing so i was skiing in vermont last weekend and i caught my ski when i was coming off the lift and i fell and my knee popped and it's hurt ever since [doctor] okay and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol [patient] i had to be taken down by the ski patrol i was unable to bear weight [doctor] okay is n't that slightly terrifying they had to do the same thing for me and you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by so anyway so what part of your knee is bothering you the most is it the inside the outside [patient] it hurts on the outside but it also feels like it wo n't hold my weight [doctor] okay so it feels like it's gon na buckle [patient] hmmm yes [doctor] okay alright and are you able to bend it [patient] i was immediately after the injury but not really now [doctor] okay and how about straightening it are you able to straighten it at all [patient] somewhat but it really hurts when i try to straighten all the way [doctor] okay alright now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes [patient] no [doctor] okay and can you feel your toes okay [patient] i think so [doctor] okay alright now are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing do you do what kind of other activities do you do [patient] i chase my two four -year-old [doctor] okay do you have twins [patient] i do [doctor] nice that's great [patient] yeah [doctor] so okay and what's your support like at home who is who is able to help out are you still doing that kind of hobbling around on crutches or [patient] yeah now my husband is home with me but he also works a job where he is gone quite a bit so it's just me and the kids [doctor] okay alright and did the ski patrol give you crutches i i see you have them here with you okay alright great and are you otherwise generally healthy [patient] yes [doctor] okay and no high blood pressure diabetes anything like that [patient] mm-hmm [doctor] no okay alright and well i i wan na go ahead let me just do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright so on your heart exam your heart sounds in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation and remind me what knee did you injure again [patient] my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay so on your right knee examination i do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when i press [patient] yes [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee there is decreased flexion and extension there is a positive lachman sign there is a palpable palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is no leg edema in the ankle okay well let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and you know my plan for you so you know i know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that did n't show any bony abnormality but i i'm concerned that you have ruptured your your acl or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth so i wan na go ahead and order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and their acl can still be torn but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee so i wan na make sure if there make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident okay i wan na go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain [patient] ibuprofen [doctor] is that helping [patient] somewhat yes [doctor] okay alright do you want something stronger [patient] no i'm okay [doctor] alright so let's just continue with ibuprofen you can take you know six hundred to eight hundred milligrams every eight hours as needed i wan na go ahead and put you in a brace that's gon na help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with your acl being injured [patient] hmmm no i not i i would like to get back to the running but currently not that active [doctor] okay alright alright do you have any questions about anything [patient] i think you've explained it well [doctor] okay alright so i'll see you again soon okay [patient] okay thank you [doctor] alright take care bye,"The patient, Michelle, injured her knee while skiing in Vermont last weekend. She fell and her knee popped, and has been experiencing pain and difficulty with movement since then.

Citizens advice scotland said the number of employment cases it had seen had risen by 12% in the last four years and was  now at its highest level.
It said the most common issues involved low pay, withheld wages and unfair dismissal, as well as bullying and discrimination.
Cas has highlighted the issues in a report to msps.
Holyrood's economy, energy and tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession.
Cas said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in scotland.
Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials.
Delivering the report to the scottish parliament, the charity's spokesman rob gowans said:  ""what our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the scottish cab (citizen advice bureaux) service over the last few years.
""while we don't give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience.
There is a growing crisis of low pay and poor conditions in scotland.
""around half of scots who are in poverty are actually working.
This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut.
He added: ""with wages falling in real terms, families are becoming trapped in poverty, less secure terms and working hours, and with basic employment rights becoming harder to enforce.""
Mr gowans also raised concerns about ""too many rogue employers"" who were ""exploiting"" workers under this environment.
""the growth in zero hours contracts has become a huge problem, which leaves thousands of scots in huge financial uncertainty.
And meanwhile it is becoming harder than ever to challenge unfair treatment,"" he added.
Snp msp christina mckelvie described the cas report as ""worrying"" and called for the scottish parliament to be given more powers over employment policy.
She said: ""this citizens advice scotland report outlines the shocking impact of austerity, social security cuts and worrying examples of employers flouting employment law.""","Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) says the country's workforce is in a ""cruel trap"" of poor conditions and low pay, with work-related cases presented to the charity up 12% in the last four years to a record level.

My plan was to leave them in the peroxide overnight and then clean them and see how they were in the morning... so i got a yellow plastic disposable cup and then put them in a bit of peroxide and let it go to see in the morning.... i forgot about them for quite a while and tonight, over a week later i decided it was time to take them out.
Being that the peroxide has been exposed to light i didn't expect much so i kind of just dumped it out and picked up the earrings... without rinsing them.

I went off to play some videogames and came back to check on them about 3 hours later.
That's when i saw 2 pairs of wings on the bottom and the praying mantis chewing on the end of another wing.
Edit: spelling","At nine years old, the author had a hobby of catching bugs to keep in their front yard and had grown a sizeable grasshopper collection housed in a terrarium. On one occasion, they caught a prevalent praying mantis and placed it in the grasshopper terrarium. Some hours later, the author returned to find the praying mantis eating a wing, implying it may have killed and eaten the grasshoppers.",gpt4,genaudit,REDDIT,,,,,,,1

ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you [patient] i'm not really sure how [doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it [patient] i think they told me it was around ten [doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt [patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct [doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening [patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me [doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound [patient] that sounds great [doctor] alright do you have any other question [patient] i do if anything happens in between [doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks [patient] okay sounds great thanks document [doctor] alright great,"Gregory, a patient with diabetes, visited his doctor due to his concern about a non-healing foot ulcer which he had for about two months. The ulcer had recently become red and has been draining, a development that had not occurred before. His foot trauma may have been caused by walking barefoot on a beach, and although he had been prescribed medication, he had yet to pick them up from the pharmacy. In addition, his diabetes was not being well-controlled, evident through his high A1C of around ten. Upon inspection, the doctor confirmed redness, swelling, and drainage from the ulcer, but no bone infection, necrosis, or bony exposure were found.",gpt4,genaudit,ACIBENCH,,,,,,,1

You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.
But shakespeare's globe on london's bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.
Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics the globe's site beside the river thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.
Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the sam wanamaker playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.
Farah karim-cooper, one of the globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.
The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"".
But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says dr karim-cooper.
The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.
""we're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says.
But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice.
Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?
It was something that happened regularly in shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor globe to an indoor playhouse such as the blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the river thames.
It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub.
The globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.
The globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.
And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.
Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.
""darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says dr karim-cooper.
""darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.
It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.""
She says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"".
Another big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.
The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.
In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.
The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.
And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.
""it was a very social occasion,"" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.
""contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says.
Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.
For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.
Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.
When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.
There are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.
It would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.
There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.
Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says.
It would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.
""in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says.
""there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.
They never heard a plane taking off.""
The language would have sounded unusual too.
The accent of the time would have meant words such as ""move"" and ""love"" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.
And the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.
The role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.
""there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.
It wouldn't work,"" says dr karim-cooper.
Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.
They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.

Every year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.
It's been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.
Dr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.

lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah

an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches [patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach

let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again [patient] okay [doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly [patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i

Rather than having links to radical islamism, he was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say.
The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury.
He has been  identified only as sergej w, and was staying in the team's hotel overlooking the scene of the attack.
Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus.
Spanish footballer marc bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock.
Following the attack on 11 april, borussia dortmund's home champions league match against monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters.
Police initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack.
However, the following week, investigators cast ""significant doubt"" on jihadist motivations being behind it.
They now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed.
Sergej w, 28, would have made about €3.9m euros ($4.2m; £3.2m) from his actions, germany's bild newspaper reported.
In a statement on friday (in german), the german federal prosecutor's office said he has german and russian nationality.
He was arrested on friday near tubingen in rottenburg, south-west germany.
The suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on borussia dortmund shares - reportedly priced at €78,000 (£65,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack.
He would have made large profits if the team's share price collapsed.
Experts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because he tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly.
He was staying at the team's l'arrivée hotel in dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say.
The suspect placed the bet on 11 april using an ip address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money.
Investigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed.
The bus was damaged about six miles from the westfalenstadion - officially called signal iduna park - in dortmund about 90 minutes before kick-off.

So i'm in my first year of college and was getting into the typical college stuff; partying, sports, alcohol, and of course academics.
About 3 weeks ago i was working on a math assignment online, which provides instant feedback on whether you got the question correct.
Typically its pretty easy and i'm done within about 30 minutes, but this one was incredibly difficult.
Already about 90 minutes in and not even halfway done, i had spent about the last 10 on one problem.
Confident in the answer i got, i submitted and saw that i was wrong.
Frustrated, i quickly (and according to my roommates, not even that hard) hit my laptop and went to see where i could have gone in the process.
I then wanted to change tabs, but for some reason my computer was not responding, which to me wasn't a big deal since it had happened a few times earlier, so i did what i normally did and did a hard power off.
Turning on the power again, my heart immediately dropped.

Computer beeping.

I immediately check my phone on the error and see that it likely has something to do with hard drive, and it was confirmed on one of the info in the settings said that no hard drive was found.

The next day i took it to the campus tech services for help.
And it took them about half a week for them to tell me that they wouldn't be able to help with the issue i originally told them about.

The next week was pretty bad, i spent it in the library or on the roommates laptops doing homework and searching on my phone for places to go to get it repaired.
And with my schedule conflicting with their open times (the only places that were open on weekends were way too expensive for my budget) and the fact that i didn't take a car to college and had to bum rides from one of my roommates, i was out of luck for that entire week.
Finally, late last week i finally got time to go to a repair place and finally get it done.
Upon immediate review the hard drive was busted and basically unsalvagable and i had to get a new one.
Luckily the people were kind and gave me a fair estimate of about $200 (which was like 1/2 other places were estimating) and also tacked on a student discount.
Still shipping for a new hard drive and repairs took a week, so that was another week in the library and borrowing laptops again.

and i caught my ski when i was coming off the lift and i fell and my knee popped and it's hurt ever since [doctor] okay and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol [patient] i had to be taken down by the ski patrol i was unable to bear weight [doctor] okay is n't that slightly terrifying they had to do the same thing for me and you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by so anyway so what part of your knee is bothering you the most is it the inside the outside [patient] it hurts on the outside but it also feels like it wo n't hold my weight [doctor] okay so it feels like it's gon na buckle [patient] hmmm yes [doctor] okay alright and are you able to bend it [patient] i was immediately after the injury but not really now [doctor] okay and how about straightening it are you able to straighten it at all [patient] somewhat but it really hurts when i try to straighten all the way [doctor] okay alright now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes [patient] no [doctor] okay and can you feel your toes okay [patient] i think so [doctor] okay alright now are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing

where he is gone quite a bit so it's just me and the kids [doctor] okay alright and did the ski patrol give you crutches i i see you have them here with you okay alright great and are you otherwise generally healthy [patient] yes [doctor] okay and no high blood pressure diabetes anything like that [patient] mm-hmm [doctor] no okay alright and well i i wan na go ahead let me just do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay alright so on your heart exam your heart sounds in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation and remind me what knee did you injure again [patient] my right knee [doctor] your right knee okay so on your right knee examination i do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when i press [patient] yes [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee there is decreased flexion and extension there is a positive lachman sign there is a palpable palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is no leg edema in the ankle okay well let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and you know my plan for you so you know i know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that did n't show any bony abnormality but i i'm concerned that you have ruptured your your acl or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth so i wan na go ahead and order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and their acl can still be torn but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee so i wan na make sure if there make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident okay i wan na go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain [patient] ibuprofen [doctor] is that helping [patient] somewhat yes [doctor] okay alright do you want something stronger [patient] no i'm okay [doctor] alright so let's just continue with ibuprofen you can take you know six hundred to eight hundred milligrams every eight hours as needed i wan na go ahead and put you in a brace that's gon na help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with your acl being injured [patient] hmmm no i not i i would like to get back to the running but currently not that active [doctor] okay alright alright do you have any questions about anything [patient] i think you've explained it well [doctor] okay alright so i'll see you again soon okay [patient] okay thank you [doctor] alright take care bye,"The patient, Michelle, injured her knee while skiing in Vermont last weekend. She fell and her knee popped, and has been experiencing pain and difficulty with movement since then. The doctor examines her knee and notes edema, an effusion, decreased flexion and extension, and a positive lachman sign.Based on these findings, the doctor orders a knee MRI to confirm the diagnosis of an ACL tear.

About a week ago i felt like my earrings were pretty disgusting so i switched them out with another pair.

I figured i'd look into some ways to clean them and after reading something (not really sure where) i settled on peroxide.
My plan was to leave them in the peroxide overnight and then clean them and see how they were in the morning... so i got a yellow plastic disposable cup and then put them in a bit of peroxide and let it go to see in the morning.... i forgot about them for quite a while and tonight, over a week later i decided it was time to take them out.
Being that the peroxide has been exposed to light i didn't expect much so i kind of just dumped it out and picked up the earrings... without rinsing them.

I think at this point , we're really going to treat it actually conservatively .
We'll have you use ice , um , uh , for the , the pain and swelling .

So i'm in my first year of college and was getting into the typical college stuff; partying, sports, alcohol, and of course academics.
About 3 weeks ago i was working on a math assignment online, which provides instant feedback on whether you got the question correct.
Typically its pretty easy and i'm done within about 30 minutes, but this one was incredibly difficult.
Already about 90 minutes in and not even halfway done, i had spent about the last 10 on one problem.
Confident in the answer i got, i submitted and saw that i was wrong.
Frustrated, i quickly (and according to my roommates, not even that hard) hit my laptop and went to see where i could have gone in the process.
I then wanted to change tabs, but for some reason my computer was not responding, which to me wasn't a big deal since it had happened a few times earlier, so i did what i normally did and did a hard power off.
Turning on the power again, my heart immediately dropped.
Black screen.
Computer beeping.
Message with something similar to 'error in bootup.'
I immediately check my phone on the error and see that it likely has something to do with hard drive, and it was confirmed on one of the info in the settings said that no hard drive was found.
Luckily my roommates were super nice and let me use one of their laptops to complete the assignment.
The next day i took it to the campus tech services for help.
And it took them about half a week for them to tell me that they wouldn't be able to help with the issue i originally told them about.
(looking back it was probably dumb to take it to them, since they aren't the biggest tech experts, but i'm a student and i'm not made of money.)
The next week was pretty bad, i spent it in the library or on the roommates laptops doing homework and searching on my phone for places to go to get it repaired.
And with my schedule conflicting with their open times (the only places that were open on weekends were way too expensive for my budget) and the fact that i didn't take a car to college and had to bum rides from one of my roommates, i was out of luck for that entire week.
Finally, late last week i finally got time to go to a repair place and finally get it done.
Upon immediate review the hard drive was busted and basically unsalvagable and i had to get a new one.
Luckily the people were kind and gave me a fair estimate of about $200 (which was like 1/2 other places were estimating) and also tacked on a student discount.
Still shipping for a new hard drive and repairs took a week, so that was another week in the library and borrowing laptops again.
Finally today i got news of it being repaired.
Spent most of the day reinstalling things and finally can get back to my usual daily life of web browsing reddit and steam games.
Math homework has also been a lot easier so the same thing repeating should hopefully be avoided for a long time now.","A college student's laptop hard drive fails, causing problems with completing homework assignments and accessing important files.

[patient] on my rake .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i was wondering where you were going to go with that .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
Great .
So , let's take a look at , uh , the x-ray of your arm .
Hey dragon , let's see the x-ray .
Okay , looking at your x-ray , i do n't see any fractures , uh , do n't really see any abnormalities at all .
It looks essentially normal .
Great .
Let me examine you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does it hurt when i press on your arm here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
How about when i bend your arm ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
That's pretty tender , ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] how about when i go backwards like that ?
[patient] not as much .
[doctor] and how about when i flex like this ?
[patient] a little .
[doctor] but mostly when i do that type of motion ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , great .
So , um , you have pain following hitting your arm on the net .
On your exam , you definitely have some tenderness over your distal radius , um , on your arm .
You have pain when i stress especially your thumb , and , and flex your thumb .
So , i think what you have is basically just a strain and maybe a contusion to that muscle , from hitting it .
Um , you certainly do n't have a fracture .
I think at this point , we're really going to treat it actually conservatively .
We'll have you use ice , um , uh , for the , the pain and swelling .
And some anti inflammatory .
Um , what we'll do is give you some motrin , 800 milligrams three times a day , with food .
Um , if it does n't get any better in the next week or so , let me know , and we'll take a look at you again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , great .
Hey dragon , go ahead and order the procedures , and the medications as discussed .
Why do n't you come with me .
Dragon you can finalize the note .
[patient] thank you .","A 43-year-old female patient, Mrs. Martinez, visited Dr. Gomez with complaints of pain in her distal radius following a tennis accident.

just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all

like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam [patient] okay,"A patient with asthma symptoms is frustrated with their condition and frequent flare-ups, which

Edwina hart accused uk officials of ""ignorance"" amid suggestions passengers could have to change trains on some services between wales and england.
Responsibility for the wales and border network will be devolved in 2017.
A department of transport spokesman said no decisions would be made without considering local views.
Services from aberystwyth to birmingham and milford haven to manchester via cardiff, are among routes which could be affected.
In last year's st david's day agreement, the uk government wrote: ""in order for the secretary of state for transport to ensure proper accountability, it is likely that services primarily serving english markets will be placed into other franchises for which the secretary of state for transport is the franchising authority"".
Responding to suggestions some passengers may have to change trains on cross-border routes, mrs hart said some whitehall officials ""don't actually understand how things work and what are important"".
""i base some of their comments on ignorance rather than a conspiracy theory,"" she said.
""we want to ensure those services remain within the franchise.""
John rogers from campaign group railfutures wales said: ""it's ludicrous, it's impractical, it's being done behind the scenes with a lot of secrecy initially and we're determined to fight it"".
""it's not in the interests of passengers.
People hate changing trains, it's a deterrent and it would affect the tourist industry,"" he added.
A department for transport spokesman said: ""we are working closely with the welsh government to develop plans for cross-border routes and stations as we move towards devolving the next wales and border franchise"".","There have been concerns that direct cross-border rail services between Wales and England could be threatened due to devolution.

Fawzi al-odah, 37, was released after a us review panel concluded he was not a ""continuing significant threat"".
He had been at the us facility in cuba since 2002 after his arrest in pakistan on suspicion of links to al-qaeda and the taliban - a charge he denies.
He had challenged america's right to detain him in the us supreme court.
Mr odah boarded a kuwaiti government plane on wednesday morning us time.
""there's no bitterness, there's no anger,"" his lawyer eric lewis was quoted as saying by the associated press news agency.
""there's just excitement and joy that he will be going home.""
The release came after guantanamo's periodic review board in july determined ""that continued law of war detention of (mr odah) does not remain necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the united states"".
But he now faces at least a year at a militant rehabilitation centre in kuwait, according to the terms of the release.
The kuwaiti government had pushed hard for the release of all kuwaiti detainees at guantanamo.
Mr odah had argued that he travelled to afghanistan and pakistan to teach the koran and provide humanitarian aid.
He is the first inmate to be freed since may, when five taliban detainees were exchanged for us sgt bowe bergdahl, who had been kept by the insurgents in afghanistan.

You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.
But shakespeare's globe on london's bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.
Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics the globe's site beside the river thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.
Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the sam wanamaker playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.
Farah karim-cooper, one of the globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.
The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"".
But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says dr karim-cooper.
The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.
""we're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says.
But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice.
Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?
It was something that happened regularly in shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor globe to an indoor playhouse such as the blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the river thames.
It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub.
The globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.
The globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.
And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.
Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.
""darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says dr karim-cooper.
""darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.
It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.""
She says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"".
Another big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.
The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.
In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.
The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.
And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.
""it was a very social occasion,"" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.
""contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says.
Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.
For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.
Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.
When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.
There are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.
It would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.
There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.
Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says.
It would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.
""in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says.
""there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.
They never heard a plane taking off.""
The language would have sounded unusual too.
The accent of the time would have meant words such as ""move"" and ""love"" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.
And the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.
The role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.

seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or [patient] yes yes that's the name of it [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help [patient] it does [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep [patient] yeah for the most part [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days [doctor] okay [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay [patient] yeah [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation [patient] probably about a month ago [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that [patient] no not really [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all [patient] hmmm hmmm [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me [doctor] okay [patient] so i do n't try to go there often [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam [patient] okay,"The patient, Betty, has been suffering from regular asthma flare-ups, triggered by illness or exposure to cats. She experiences symptoms such as coughing and wheezing almost every day, and has had to visit urgent care and her primary care provider frequently over the past six months. On a few occasions, she had to go to the emergency room, once of which resulted in hospitalization when she was young. She typically uses a blue albuterol inhaler that provides relief, and has also been prescribed antibiotics and steroids sometimes. Her last asthma exacerbation was around a month ago. Despite her condition, she enjoys outdoor activities like hiking. She confirmed that she's a non-smoker and doesn't have any history of seasonal allergies.",gpt4,genaudit,ACIBENCH,On a few occasions,highlight-somewhat_mistake,,not_likely,common,low_consequence,1

foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it [patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly [doctor] do n't recall alright [patient] something i had taken it before [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it [patient] i'm sorry [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red [doctor] okay [patient] i have n't had that before [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled [patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time [doctor] okay do you

your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness

The doctor suspected an infection and ordered an ABI (ankle brachial index) test to determine blood supply to the foot.

two months. The ulcer had recently become red and has been draining, a development that had not occurred before. His foot trauma may have been caused by walking barefoot on a beach, and although he had been prescribed medication, he had yet to pick them up from the pharmacy. In addition, his diabetes was not being well-controlled, evident through his high A1C of around ten. Upon inspection, the doctor confirmed redness, swelling, and drainage from the ulcer, but no bone infection, necrosis, or bony exposure were found.",gpt4,genaudit,ACIBENCH,,,,,,,1

Edwina hart accused uk officials of ""ignorance"" amid suggestions passengers could have to change trains on some services between wales and england.
Responsibility for the wales and border network will be devolved in 2017.
A department of transport spokesman said no decisions would be made without considering local views.
Services from aberystwyth to birmingham and milford haven to manchester via cardiff, are among routes which could be affected.
In last year's st david's day agreement, the uk government wrote: ""in order for the secretary of state for transport to ensure proper accountability, it is likely that services primarily serving english markets will be placed into other franchises for which the secretary of state for transport is the franchising authority"".
Responding to suggestions some passengers may have to change trains on cross-border routes, mrs hart said some whitehall officials ""don't actually understand how things work and what are important"".
""i base some of their comments on ignorance rather than a conspiracy theory,"" she said.
""we want to ensure those services remain within the franchise.""
John rogers from campaign group railfutures wales said: ""it's ludicrous, it's impractical, it's being done behind the scenes with a lot of secrecy initially and we're determined to fight it"".
""it's not in the interests of passengers.
People hate changing trains, it's a deterrent and it would affect the tourist industry,"" he added.
A department for transport spokesman said: ""we are working closely with the welsh government to develop plans for cross-border routes and stations as we move towards devolving the next wales and border franchise"".","Wales' transport minister, Edwina Hart, has dismissed claims that direct cross-border rail services between Wales and England could be under threat due to devolution.

order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and their acl can still be torn but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee so i wan na make sure if there make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident okay i wan na go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain [patient] ibuprofen [doctor] is that helping [patient] somewhat yes [doctor] okay alright do you want something stronger [patient] no i'm okay

help your knee feel a bit more supported okay and let's go ahead and i'm hoping that we can get this mri done in you know the next couple days and then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now you said that you are are are you know obviously a very active active mom any other exercise or anything else that that i should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your with your acl being injured [patient] hmmm no i not i i would like to get back to the running but currently not that active [doctor] okay alright alright do you have any questions about anything [patient] i think you've explained it well [doctor] okay alright so i'll see you again soon okay [patient] okay thank you [doctor] alright take care bye,"The patient, Michelle, injured her knee while skiing in Vermont last weekend.

michael yeah so my son sean i think you met in the past he he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen [doctor] yeah [patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym [doctor] okay [patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so [doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way [patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys [doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad [patient] yeah yes [doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too [patient] yeah a little bit [doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all [patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid [doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable [patient] yeah [doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the

Rather than having links to radical islamism, he was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say.
The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury.
He has been  identified only as sergej w, and was staying in the team's hotel overlooking the scene of the attack.
Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus.
Spanish footballer marc bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock.
Following the attack on 11 april, borussia dortmund's home champions league match against monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters.
Police initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack.
However, the following week, investigators cast ""significant doubt"" on jihadist motivations being behind it.
They now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed.
Sergej w, 28, would have made about €3.9m euros ($4.2m; £3.2m) from his actions, germany's bild newspaper reported.
In a statement on friday (in german), the german federal prosecutor's office said he has german and russian nationality.
He was arrested on friday near tubingen in rottenburg, south-west germany.
The suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on borussia dortmund shares - reportedly priced at €78,000 (£65,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack.
He would have made large profits if the team's share price collapsed.
Experts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because he tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly.
He was staying at the team's l'arrivée hotel in dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say.
The suspect placed the bet on 11 april using an ip address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money.
Investigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed.

Fawzi al-odah, 37, was released after a us review panel concluded he was not a ""continuing significant threat"".
He had been at the us facility in cuba since 2002 after his arrest in pakistan on suspicion of links to al-qaeda and the taliban - a charge he denies.
He had challenged america's right to detain him in the us supreme court.
Mr odah boarded a kuwaiti government plane on wednesday morning us time.
""there's no bitterness, there's no anger,"" his lawyer eric lewis was quoted as saying by the associated press news agency.
""there's just excitement and joy that he will be going home.""
The release came after guantanamo's periodic review board in july determined ""that continued law of war detention of (mr odah) does not remain necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the united states"".
But he now faces at least a year at a militant rehabilitation centre in kuwait, according to the terms of the release.
The kuwaiti government had pushed hard for the release of all kuwaiti detainees at guantanamo.
Mr odah had argued that he travelled to afghanistan and pakistan to teach the koran and provide humanitarian aid.
He is the first inmate to be freed since may, when five taliban detainees were exchanged for us sgt bowe bergdahl, who had been kept by the insurgents in afghanistan.
Mr odah's release brings down the total number of inmates at the us naval base to 148.

You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.
But shakespeare's globe on london's bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.
Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics the globe's site beside the river thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.
Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the sam wanamaker playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.
Farah karim-cooper, one of the globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.
The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"".
But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says dr karim-cooper.
The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.
""we're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says.
But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice.
Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?
It was something that happened regularly in shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor globe to an indoor playhouse such as the blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the river thames.
It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub.
The globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.
The globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.
And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.
Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era.
""darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says dr karim-cooper.
""darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick.
It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.""
She says that if elizabethans or jacobeans travelled in time to modern london ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"".
Another big difference is that shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.
The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.
In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen.
The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.
And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.
""it was a very social occasion,"" says dr karim-cooper, describing the shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.
""contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says.
Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.
For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says dr karim-cooper.
Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue.
When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.
There are other big changes between a modern and shakespearean theatre visit.
It would have smelled very different, says dr karim-cooper.
There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.
Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says.
It would have been a much softer sound, as elizabethan london didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.
""in terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says.
""there are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming.
They never heard a plane taking off.""
The language would have sounded unusual too.
The accent of the time would have meant words such as ""move"" and ""love"" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.
And the globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.
The role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.
""there is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do.
It wouldn't work,"" says dr karim-cooper.
Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions.
They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.
""we want to get beyond wikipedia,"" she says.
She is co-editor of moving shakespeare indoors, a collection of essays on indoor jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the globe's work.
There is a postgraduate degree course in shakespeare studies with king's college, london.
There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.
Every year there is a landmark schools production, the playing shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for london pupils.
It's been a huge success, with many  coming to see shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.
Dr karim-cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.
""we want to become a research hub.
We want students to be here.""
The ""unique blend"" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the ""literary rigour"".
""we don't separate the practical from the academic.""","The Globe Theatre in London has a unique approach to theatrical performances, combining academic rigor with practical experimentation. The theatre's research team, led by Farah Karim-Cooper, provides insights and advice to actors and directors, drawing from historical evidence and contemporary sources. The team also works with local schools and offers a postgraduate degree course in Shakespeare Studies.
