About a week ago i felt like my earrings were pretty disgusting so i switched them out with another pair.
Being a dude who hasn't really worn earrings much in the past i've tried cleaning them a bunch of times but they never quite got the clean i wanted them to be.
I figured i'd look into some ways to clean them and after reading something (not really sure where) i settled on peroxide.
My plan was to leave them in the peroxide overnight and then clean them and see how they were in the morning... so i got a yellow plastic disposable cup and then put them in a bit of peroxide and let it go to see in the morning.... i forgot about them for quite a while and tonight, over a week later i decided it was time to take them out.
Being that the peroxide has been exposed to light i didn't expect much so i kind of just dumped it out and picked up the earrings... without rinsing them.
Now the gauge looks slightly bigger than my replacements so i decided to put one in to see if it fit still, and it did, you'd think that'd be the end of it right?
Wrong.
I put them on the counter and go to bed, about 5 minutes later i feel a burning sensation on my nose.... my hand... my ear?
Seeing as how i've had a traumatic week i'm not too worried about it, i feel like i'm just paranoid, so i get up just to check at a leisurely pace and turn on the light.... to see the tip of my nose, and a bit of both my hands bleaching quickly.
Quickly i begin flushing my skin with water and called poison control, who simply suggested keep doing as i have been.
So now part of my skin is mildly bleached, i'm throbbing in pain, and i can't fall asleep.

How are you ... how are you doing with that ?

So on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck .

[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .

Virtual was a bit of a struggle , but i feel like being in-person with someone really helps me .
[doctor] okay .
And do y- do you have a good support system at home ?
[patient] yes , i do .
I have my husband and , uh , my kids are right down the street from me , so i'm very lucky .
[doctor] okay .
All right .
So that's good to hear .
[doctor] how about your blood pressure ?
Did you buy the blood pressure cuff that i- [patient] yes .
[doctor] .
Told you to ?
Okay .
I know that we've been in communication and your blood pressures have been running okay .
The last time i spoke with you , how are they doing since we last spoke ?
[patient] they've been doing well .
I've been using the cuff , um , once a day , and they seem pretty normal .
[doctor] okay .
And are you taking the lisinopril that i prescribed ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
Great .
All right .
So i know that you did a review of systems sheet with the nurse when you checked in .
You know , i know that you were talking about some nasal congestion .
Do you have any other symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no ?
Okay .
All right .
Well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the vital signs .
So here in the office , you know , your blood pressure looks really good , as does your heart rate .
So you are doing a good job managing your blood pressure .
So i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay .
So on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck .
On your heart exam i do notice a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable .
Your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ?
But i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .
Hey , dragon , show me the ekg .
And the nurses did an ekg before you came in , and that looks perfectly fine , okay ?
So i wan na just go ahead and talk a little about your assessment and my plan for you .
So for your first problem , your depression , i think you're doing a really good job with your strategies .
I do n't think ... it does n't sound to me like i need to start you on any medication at this time , unless you feel differently .
[patient] no , i'm , i'm , good in that department .
[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .
I wan na just continue on the lisinopril , 20 milligrams a day .
And i want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well , and if they start rising , i want you to contact me , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and for your third problem , for an annual exam maintenance , you know , you're due for a mammogram , so we'll go ahead and schedule that , okay ?
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right .
Do you have any questions ?
[patient] um , can i take all my medicine at the same time ?
Does it matter ?
[doctor] yeah .
You can set an alarm so that it reminds you to take your medication .
But yeah , you can , you can take them altogether .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .

And , and it just jarred my arm .
[doctor] okay .
And did it swell up at all ?
Or- [patient] it did .
It got a ... it had a little bit of swelling .
Not a lot .
[doctor] okay .
And , um , did , uh , do you have any numbness in your hand at all ?
Or any pain when you move your wrist ?
[patient] a little bit when i move my wrist .
Um , no numbness in my hand .
[doctor] okay .
Do you have any past medical history of anything ?
[patient] um , yes .
Allergic , um , l- i have allergies .
And so i take flonase .
[doctor] okay .
And any surgeries in the past ?
[patient] yes .
I actually had a trauma of , um , a stabbing of , um ... i actually fell doing lawn work- [doctor] okay .
[patient] on my rake .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i was wondering where you were going to go with that .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
Great .
So , let's take a look at , uh , the x-ray of your arm .
Hey dragon , let's see the x-ray .
Okay , looking at your x-ray , i do n't see any fractures , uh , do n't really see any abnormalities at all .
It looks essentially normal .
Great .
Let me examine you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does it hurt when i press on your arm here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
How about when i bend your arm ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
That's pretty tender , ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] how about when i go backwards like that ?
[patient] not as much .
[doctor] and how about when i flex like this ?
[patient] a little .
[doctor] but mostly when i do that type of motion ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , great .
So , um , you have pain following hitting your arm on the net .
On your exam , you definitely have some tenderness over your distal radius , um , on your arm .
You have pain when i stress especially your thumb , and , and flex your thumb .
So , i think what you have is basically just a strain and maybe a contusion to that muscle , from hitting it .
Um , you certainly do n't have a fracture .
I think at this point , we're really going to treat it actually conservatively .
We'll have you use ice , um , uh , for the , the pain and swelling .
And some anti inflammatory .
Um , what we'll do is give you some motrin , 800 milligrams three times a day , with food .
Um , if it does n't get any better in the next week or so , let me know , and we'll take a look at you again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , great .
Hey dragon , go ahead and order the procedures , and the medications as discussed .
Why do n't you come with me .
Dragon you can finalize the note .
[patient] thank you .","Mrs. Martinez visited Dr. Gomez due to pain in her arm, specifically towards her wrist, which she incurred while playing tennis. She reported slight swelling and a little pain when moving her wrist, but no numbness in her hand. Her medical history includes allergies and a past incident of injuring herself with a rake during yard work. Dr. Gomez examined an X-ray of Mrs. Martinez’s arm, which revealed no fractures or abnormalities. He further examined her arm manually, diagnosing a strain and possibly a contusion from her tennis mishap, with no indication of a fracture. The doctor recommended conservative treatment with ice for the pain and swelling, and prescribed anti-inflammatory Motrin.

Today was a late meet for me (8pm meet) and it is a rule we must dress up for a meet.
My girlfriend has a normal practice today, normally school gets out at 3:02 and her practice is at 3:15. she has to get changed so i wait outside the locker rooms for her so i could give her a kiss goodbye.
What i don't realize is that my bus leaves while i'm standing outside the locker rooms.
Being a slow dresser she is in there till the last minute.
After she comes out i give her a kiss goodbye and walk outside.
There was nothing, nobody, but the steady snow fall.
Naturally i freak out and start making calls, my friend says he got dropped off already so i call my house... no answer.. my parents and older sister are working so no answer from them.. now i'm paying the price with a 6 mile walk hold in freezing temperatures in my thin dress shirt and no gloves or hat.

[doctor] yeah , i know .
I've ... i mean , we've had some communication over telehealth and that type of thing , but it's not the same as being in-person , so i'm happy to see you today .
Now tell me a little bit about , you know , we have n't really got a chance to talk about your depression .
How are you ... how are you doing with that ?
I know we have n't had you on medication in the past because you're on medication for other things .
What are your strategies with dealing with it ?
[patient] so i've been going to therapy once a week for the past year .
Um , mostly virtually , um , but starting to get in-person .
Virtual was a bit of a struggle , but i feel like being in-person with someone really helps me .
[doctor] okay .
And do y- do you have a good support system at home ?
[patient] yes , i do .
I have my husband and , uh , my kids are right down the street from me , so i'm very lucky .
[doctor] okay .

[doctor] how about your blood pressure ?
Did you buy the blood pressure cuff that i- [patient] yes .
[doctor] .
Told you to ?
Okay .
I know that we've been in communication and your blood pressures have been running okay .
The last time i spoke with you , how are they doing since we last spoke ?
[patient] they've been doing well .
I've been using the cuff , um , once a day , and they seem pretty normal .
[doctor] okay .
And are you taking the lisinopril that i prescribed ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
Great .
All right .
So i know that you did a review of systems sheet with the nurse when you checked in .
You know , i know that you were talking about some nasal congestion .
Do you have any other symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no ?
Okay .
All right .
Well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the vital signs .
So here in the office , you know , your blood pressure looks really good , as does your heart rate .
So you are doing a good job managing your blood pressure .
So i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay .
So on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck .
On your heart exam i do notice a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable .
Your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ?
But i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .
Hey , dragon , show me the ekg .
And the nurses did an ekg before you came in , and that looks perfectly fine , okay ?
So i wan na just go ahead and talk a little about your assessment and my plan for you .
So for your first problem , your depression , i think you're doing a really good job with your strategies .
I do n't think ... it does n't sound to me like i need to start you on any medication at this time , unless you feel differently .
[patient] no , i'm , i'm , good in that department .
[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .
I wan na just continue on the lisinopril , 20 milligrams a day .
And i want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well , and if they start rising , i want you to contact me , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and for your third problem , for an annual exam maintenance , you know , you're due for a mammogram , so we'll go ahead and schedule that , okay ?
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right .
Do you have any questions ?
[patient] um , can i take all my medicine at the same time ?
Does it matter ?
[doctor] yeah .
You can set an alarm so that it reminds you to take your medication .
But yeah , you can , you can take them altogether .

Citizens advice scotland said the number of employment cases it had seen had risen by 12% in the last four years and was  now at its highest level.
It said the most common issues involved low pay, withheld wages and unfair dismissal, as well as bullying and discrimination.
Cas has highlighted the issues in a report to msps.
Holyrood's economy, energy and tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession.
Cas said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in scotland.
Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials.
Delivering the report to the scottish parliament, the charity's spokesman rob gowans said:  ""what our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the scottish cab (citizen advice bureaux) service over the last few years.
""while we don't give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience.
There is a growing crisis of low pay and poor conditions in scotland.
""around half of scots who are in poverty are actually working.
This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut.
He added: ""with wages falling in real terms, families are becoming trapped in poverty, less secure terms and working hours, and with basic employment rights becoming harder to enforce.""
Mr gowans also raised concerns about ""too many rogue employers"" who were ""exploiting"" workers under this environment.
""the growth in zero hours contracts has become a huge problem, which leaves thousands of scots in huge financial uncertainty.
And meanwhile it is becoming harder than ever to challenge unfair treatment,"" he added.
Snp msp christina mckelvie described the cas report as ""worrying"" and called for the scottish parliament to be given more powers over employment policy.
She said: ""this citizens advice scotland report outlines the shocking impact of austerity, social security cuts and worrying examples of employers flouting employment law.""","A report by Citizens Advice Scotland has found that the country's workforce is facing a crisis of low pay and poor conditions, with a 12% increase in employment cases over the past four years.

Cas has highlighted the issues in a report to msps.
Holyrood's economy, energy and tourism committee is exploring how employment and job quality has changed since the 2008 recession.
Cas said it had gathered evidence showing workplace problems were growing in scotland.
Staff across its 61 sites reported that they were increasingly advising clients who were in work but struggling to pay for essentials.
Delivering the report to the scottish parliament, the charity's spokesman rob gowans said:  ""what our report shows is the collected evidence of all the work-related cases that people have brought to the scottish cab (citizen advice bureaux) service over the last few years.
""while we don't give away the identities of any of our clients, our evidence shows real-life experience.
There is a growing crisis of low pay and poor conditions in scotland.
""around half of scots who are in poverty are actually working.
This reflects the fact that the minimum wage is not in fact keeping up with inflation, and many of the benefits that are meant to supplement low wages are being cut.
He added: ""with wages falling in real terms, families are becoming trapped in poverty, less secure terms and working hours, and with basic employment rights becoming harder to enforce.""
Mr gowans also raised concerns about ""too many rogue employers"" who were ""exploiting"" workers under this environment.
""the growth in zero hours contracts has become a huge problem, which leaves thousands of scots in huge financial uncertainty.
And meanwhile it is becoming harder than ever to challenge unfair treatment,"" he added.
Snp msp christina mckelvie described the cas report as ""worrying"" and called for the scottish parliament to be given more powers over employment policy.
She said: ""this citizens advice scotland report outlines the shocking impact of austerity, social security cuts and worrying examples of employers flouting employment law.""","Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) says the country's workforce is in a ""cruel trap"" of poor conditions and low pay, with work-related cases presented to the charity up 12% in the last four years to a record level.

On your exam , you definitely have some tenderness over your distal radius , um , on your arm .
You have pain when i stress especially your thumb , and , and flex your thumb .
So , i think what you have is basically just a strain and maybe a contusion to that muscle , from hitting it .
Um , you certainly do n't have a fracture .
I think at this point , we're really going to treat it actually conservatively .
We'll have you use ice , um , uh , for the , the pain and swelling .

Hey , dragon , finalize the note .","The document outlines a conversation between a doctor and a patient named Elizabeth, a 66-year-old woman with a medical history of depression and hypertension. Elizabeth gets a regular annual checkup and mentions she has been dealing with her depression with weekly therapy sessions, mostly virtual but some recently in person. She also has a strong support system at home, comprising her husband and kids who live nearby. Elizabeth has been controlling her hypertension through prescribed lisinopril and monitored blood pressure, which has been stable. The doctor praises her for managing her condition well and asks her to maintain her current course of medication, while also advising her to keep an eye on her blood pressure levels.",gpt4,genaudit,ACIBENCH,The document,highlight-inference,,likely,common,low_consequence,1

Today was a late meet for me (8pm meet) and it is a rule we must dress up for a meet.
My girlfriend has a normal practice today, normally school gets out at 3:02 and her practice is at 3:15. she has to get changed so i wait outside the locker rooms for her so i could give her a kiss goodbye.
What i don't realize is that my bus leaves while i'm standing outside the locker rooms.
Being a slow dresser she is in there till the last minute.
After she comes out i give her a kiss goodbye and walk outside.
There was nothing, nobody, but the steady snow fall.
Naturally i freak out and start making calls, my friend says he got dropped off already so i call my house... no answer.. my parents and older sister are working so no answer from them.. now i'm paying the price with a 6 mile walk hold in freezing temperatures in my thin dress shirt and no gloves or hat.
Wish me luck!
