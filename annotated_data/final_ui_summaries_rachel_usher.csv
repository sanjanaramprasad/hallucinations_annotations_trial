Today was a late meet for me (8pm meet) and it is a rule we must dress up for a meet.
My girlfriend has a normal practice today, normally school gets out at 3:02 and her practice is at 3:15. she has to get changed so i wait outside the locker rooms for her so i could give her a kiss goodbye.
What i don't realize is that my bus leaves while i'm standing outside the locker rooms.
Being a slow dresser she is in there till the last minute.
After she comes out i give her a kiss goodbye and walk outside.
There was nothing, nobody, but the steady snow fall.
Naturally i freak out and start making calls, my friend says he got dropped off already so i call my house... no answer.. my parents and older sister are working so no answer from them.. now i'm paying the price with a 6 mile walk hold in freezing temperatures in my thin dress shirt and no gloves or hat.
Wish me luck!

Now tell me a little bit about , you know , we have n't really got a chance to talk about your depression .
How are you ... how are you doing with that ?
I know we have n't had you on medication in the past because you're on medication for other things .
What are your strategies with dealing with it ?
[patient] so i've been going to therapy once a week for the past year .

So i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay .
So on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck .
On your heart exam i do notice a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable .
Your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ?
But i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?

I do n't think ... it does n't sound to me like i need to start you on any medication at this time , unless you feel differently .
[patient] no , i'm , i'm , good in that department .
[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .
I wan na just continue on the lisinopril , 20 milligrams a day .
And i want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well , and if they start rising , i want you to contact me , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and for your third problem , for an annual exam maintenance , you know , you're due for a mammogram , so we'll go ahead and schedule that , okay ?

[doctor] all right .
Do you have any questions ?
[patient] um , can i take all my medicine at the same time ?

Today was a late meet for me (8pm meet) and it is a rule we must dress up for a meet.
My girlfriend has a normal practice today, normally school gets out at 3:02 and her practice is at 3:15. she has to get changed so i wait outside the locker rooms for her so i could give her a kiss goodbye.
What i don't realize is that my bus leaves while i'm standing outside the locker rooms.
Being a slow dresser she is in there till the last minute.
After she comes out i give her a kiss goodbye and walk outside.
There was nothing, nobody, but the steady snow fall.
Naturally i freak out and start making calls, my friend says he got dropped off already so i call my house... no answer.. my parents and older sister are working so no answer from them.. now i'm paying the price with a 6 mile walk hold in freezing temperatures in my thin dress shirt and no gloves or hat.

I'd like to tell dax a little bit about you , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .
Elizabeth is a 66-year-old female with a past medical history of significant for depression and hypertension who presents for her annual exam .
So elizabeth , it's been a year since i've seen you .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] how are you doing ?
[patient] i'm doing well .
There's been so many events now that we've been able to get vaccinated , i've been able to see my grandkids again , go to more birthday parties , it's been fantastic .
[doctor] yeah , i know .
I've ... i mean , we've had some communication over telehealth and that type of thing , but it's not the same as being in-person , so i'm happy to see you today .
Now tell me a little bit about , you know , we have n't really got a chance to talk about your depression .
How are you ... how are you doing with that ?
I know we have n't had you on medication in the past because you're on medication for other things .
What are your strategies with dealing with it ?
[patient] so i've been going to therapy once a week for the past year .
Um , mostly virtually , um , but starting to get in-person .
Virtual was a bit of a struggle , but i feel like being in-person with someone really helps me .
[doctor] okay .
And do y- do you have a good support system at home ?
[patient] yes , i do .
I have my husband and , uh , my kids are right down the street from me , so i'm very lucky .
[doctor] okay .
All right .
So that's good to hear .
[doctor] how about your blood pressure ?
Did you buy the blood pressure cuff that i- [patient] yes .
[doctor] .
Told you to ?
Okay .
I know that we've been in communication and your blood pressures have been running okay .
The last time i spoke with you , how are they doing since we last spoke ?
[patient] they've been doing well .
I've been using the cuff , um , once a day , and they seem pretty normal .
[doctor] okay .
And are you taking the lisinopril that i prescribed ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay .
Great .
All right .
So i know that you did a review of systems sheet with the nurse when you checked in .
You know , i know that you were talking about some nasal congestion .
Do you have any other symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no ?
Okay .
All right .
Well , i wan na go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the vital signs .
So here in the office , you know , your blood pressure looks really good , as does your heart rate .
So you are doing a good job managing your blood pressure .
So i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay .
So on physical examination , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits in your neck .
On your heart exam i do notice a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past , so i think that's stable .
Your lungs in- are nice and clear , and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally , so all that means is , you know , i agree , you know , maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better , okay ?
But i wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right .
Hey , dragon , show me the ekg .
And the nurses did an ekg before you came in , and that looks perfectly fine , okay ?
So i wan na just go ahead and talk a little about your assessment and my plan for you .
So for your first problem , your depression , i think you're doing a really good job with your strategies .
I do n't think ... it does n't sound to me like i need to start you on any medication at this time , unless you feel differently .
[patient] no , i'm , i'm , good in that department .
[doctor] for your second problem , your high blood pressure , i agree , everything looks fine here now .
I wan na just continue on the lisinopril , 20 milligrams a day .
And i want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well , and if they start rising , i want you to contact me , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and for your third problem , for an annual exam maintenance , you know , you're due for a mammogram , so we'll go ahead and schedule that , okay ?
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right .
Do you have any questions ?
[patient] um , can i take all my medicine at the same time ?
Does it matter ?
[doctor] yeah .
You can set an alarm so that it reminds you to take your medication .
But yeah , you can , you can take them altogether .
[patient] okay .
